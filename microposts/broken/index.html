<title>Fixed a Problem With Flickr Photo Galleries  |  ~ The Tobyblog üìù</title>
<meta name="description" content="The personal blog and home page of one of the web&#39;s many Tobys. What distinguishes me is that I own the domain. To you I say welcome(!) in the grand old tradition of proto-websites of the nineties. The place where I deposit the overflow of my time, mind, and labors, Tobyblog is my refuge from the coming social media apocalypse.">
