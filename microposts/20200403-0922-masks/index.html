     <p>Yesterday was the first day that I saw several people wearing masks at the store. It made me self-conscious. I found out my father already wears one whenever he&rsquo;s out in public. I was surprised when he told me because I don&rsquo;t generally think of him as being more engaged and socially conscious than us &ldquo;young&rdquo; city dwellers. Guess I was wrong about that. I don&rsquo;t even have a mask. Laredo has already mandated them with up to a $1000 fine for violators. I expect we&rsquo;ll be seeing those kinds of enforcements all over the country within a few weeks time. I wonder if we can even get some. Or if it would be possible to improvise one.</p>
