<title>Masks  |  ~ The Tobyblog üìù</title>
<meta name="description" content="The personal blog and home page of one of the web&#39;s many Tobys. What distinguishes me is that I own the domain. To you I say welcome(!) in the grand old tradition of proto-websites of the nineties. The place where I deposit the overflow of my time, mind, and labors, Tobyblog is my refuge from the coming social media apocalypse.">

  <meta property="og:description" content="Yesterday was the first day that I saw several people wearing masks at the store. It made me self-conscious.

I was surprised when he told me because I don‚Äôt generally think of him as being more engaged and socially conscious than us ‚Äúyoung‚Äù city dwellers. Guess I was wrong about that. I don‚Äôt even have a mask. Laredo has already mandated them with up to a $1000 fine for violators. I expect we‚Äôll be seeing those kinds of enforcements all over the country within a few weeks time. I wonder if we can even get some. Or if it would be possible to improvise one.">
