<title>Happy New Year 2020  |  ~ The Tobyblog üìù</title>
<meta name="description" content="The personal blog and home page of one of the web&#39;s many Tobys. What distinguishes me is that I own the domain. To you I say welcome(!) in the grand old tradition of proto-websites of the nineties. The place where I deposit the overflow of my time, mind, and labors, Tobyblog is my refuge from the coming social media apocalypse.">

  <meta property="og:description" content="2020 It‚Äôs January 1, and before we know it we‚Äôve found ourselves on the back side of another year (and another decade). It‚Äôs a special moment when time presents us with an opportunity for reevaluating ourselves, our habits, and our lives ‚Äî¬†where we‚Äôve been, and where we are going. Don‚Äôt neglect that opportunity. Change is like the fresh air in our life, and we need just enough to keep our lungs and blood full of oxygen. We get worn down over the course of a year, and then like magic we get this wonderful new vitality out of nowhere that gives us the strength to start again, with new determination and a new sense of purpose. Use it for something good.">

<p>It&rsquo;s January 1, and before we know it we&rsquo;ve found ourselves on the back side of another year (and another decade). It&rsquo;s a special moment when time presents us with an opportunity for reevaluating ourselves, our habits, and our lives ‚Äî¬†where we&rsquo;ve been, and where we are going. Don&rsquo;t neglect that opportunity. Change is like the fresh air in our life, and we need just enough to keep our lungs and blood full of oxygen. We get worn down over the course of a year, and then like magic we get this wonderful new vitality out of nowhere that gives us the strength to start again, with new determination and a new sense of purpose. Use it for something good.</p>
<p>I pray that God bless and preserve all of you in the new year. Going by the news, we&rsquo;re in for interesting times.</p>
