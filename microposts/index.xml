        <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve visited a few spots with some potential for accidents, but so far my worst vacation injuries have been banging my head on the roof of the car unloading luggage (last year; my neck was sore for days), and scraping up my arm pretty bad after tripping over luggage in the dark (last night). It seems I have a problem with luggage.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s summer vacation time again, and I&amp;rsquo;m as excited as if I were returning to Hogwarts after a summer at the Dursley&amp;rsquo;s ‚Äî¬†a completely made up expression that I thought of just now purely as an excuse to post the picture below, of which I happen to be fond. Back when I had hair I might have been able to pass off a kind of Harry Potter-esque look. Now it&amp;rsquo;s more like Filch. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few ideas lately for more traditional kinds of posts, but I&amp;rsquo;m afraid those will have to take the backburner as I work on more trip photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It took a bit of effort to get everything tweaked just right for mobile, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded my photo galleries to use the popular &amp;ldquo;lightbox&amp;rdquo; style layout. There&amp;rsquo;s of course some Javascript overhead that I regret, but I think that&amp;rsquo;s offset somewhat by lazy loading and the use of thumbnails. See whether you think response time has improved. It&amp;rsquo;s not everywhere yet, just on recent galleries like &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Flight to LA&lt;/a&gt; and probably all stuff going forward from that, unless I&amp;rsquo;m posting from my phone. The old stuff should work the same. Best experienced on a laptop or desktop, of course, where you get the nice grid layout with all the thumbnails. I like that you can get a real sense of everything all at once, and then start exploring where you wish, vs being forced to scroll past photos in order to take everything in. Hopefully that leads to a more intentional viewing experience. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Must be time for a road trip, because I find myself wondering what the wagon would look like with wood paneling.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, well. Look who‚Äôs back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve heard rumors that the Lemax stuff is already on sale at Michaels, too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me today, as I was getting my hair cut, that Guns N‚Äò Roses really jumped the shark with November Rain. In fact, I‚Äôd say November Rain is what killed Hair Rock.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One wonders how one gets to be a known walker. Do you introduce yourself? Do you have to register at the office? Are there name tags?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any event, I would love to get my hands on that (presumably massive) unknown mall walker dossier down at the precinct. Must be how they break in the rookie detectives.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Been reading a bit about Kodachrome film processing since I saw this picture on a photo forum. Those vivid, deep colors really get to me. I‚Äôm trying to understand the color principles well enough to reproduce something like that in my own photo processing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I live in Dallas and tonight was the first time I have ever seen anyone wearing a #MAGA hat out in public. Some old guy at Lowes. Just thought I should document that for posterity. And no, he did not appear to be buying any tiki torches, nor was his heart very obviously consumed with hatred for brown people, so as to make me hate him. Just an old man.&lt;/p&gt;

        <author>Toby Marks</author>
        <guid>http://tobyblog.com/microposts/the-holdouts-of-collin-creek/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are only a handful of stores left standing now at Collin Creek Mall in Plano. It‚Äôll all be torn down soon. I‚Äôve worked many mornings from the food court there, just me and the old folks who walk the mall and meet up for coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mall is being razed to build a new billion dollar open air, multi-use development that will host stores, apartments, green space, and even a &amp;ldquo;lagoon&amp;rdquo; of all things. It&amp;rsquo;ll take six years to build, if everything goes according to plan. Judging by the impact of other recent construction in the area, the whole place will be off-limits for vehicle traffic for quite some time to come. I&amp;rsquo;ll need to find some new working spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard they&amp;rsquo;re going to excavate the drainage tunnels under the mall in order to expose the creek that runs under the parking lot. They say there are homeless folks that live down there, underground. And criminals have been known to dart into those tunnels when being chased by the cops. There&amp;rsquo;s a geocache down there, placed by one of the founding members of the Texas Geocaching Association, a guy who goes by the online handle of 9key, a legend among Texas geocachers. I suppose I missed my chance to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In trying to recall the name of my new favorite artist after the Cottonwood show, I somehow misremembered her name as ‚ÄúAlyssa Stank‚Äù, which I actually googled. Alyssa Stank. That could be a name. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Something that popped up in my Instagram feed. Win a trip for two to London? Maybe a good excuse for a little Harry/Hermione cosplay. Might have to borrow the kid‚Äôs graduation robe&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;First off, this. Nostalgia community, we need to have a deep and confronting conversation. It‚Äôs time to stop pretending you like The Golden Girls. Nobody but your grandma liked The Golden Girls, and that‚Äôs exactly as it should be. Your unnatural determination to make The Golden Girls a ‚Äúthing‚Äù amongst thirty-something &lt;em&gt;males&lt;/em&gt; has led to this abomination, and it‚Äôs time we as a society put an end to this madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it‚Äôs been a busy few days. It‚Äôs a lot of work graduating a kid. Between that and home and my professional duties I‚Äôve been swamped. Such is the life of a dad. Since my last teaser post it‚Äôs only now that I feel like I can catch my breath a bit and recollect on some things I‚Äôd like to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you all are having a warm and magical evening.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A mostly liquid lunch, but not too bad, considering. It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve had a Taro Boba. It may be my favorite flavor, and is something like blueberry crossed with macadamia nut.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;See that Transformers insignia on that Corolla? &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; had that idea. Back in 1986. And now some jerk is getting rich off &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep. Putting Transformers insignia on Corollas. All mine.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;üõ†üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Major site updates! A lot of you might not be aware that in years past I made a lot of videos for the site. You&amp;rsquo;ll now notice a &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/videos/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Videos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tab up at the top to make it easy to find those. Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve settled on how I&amp;rsquo;m going to use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/microposts/&#34;&gt;Microposts&lt;/a&gt; feature of blog, which mainly I&amp;rsquo;ll reserve for short text-only updates like these, or short Tweet-like content. As a result, I moved a lot of my Microposts for this year under &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/&#34;&gt;Posts&lt;/a&gt;, which as an added benefit will allow you to comment on my photoblog stuff. Have fun poking around.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://tobyblog.com/microposts/a-lenten-meditation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The soul has to make a choice, and the outcome will either break it into pieces or enable it to sail to its destination in God. And the choice comes down to this: Will the soul accept or reject suffering? Will it make this suffering its own, or struggle against it, seeing it as something alien to itself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;If he chooses to accept his suffering, he must embrace it with the wholeness of his life; he must discover and accept the proper relation to his suffering. If he can do this, he will have transformed his suffering so that in the end his only reality will be God. But if he continues to resist his suffering, refusing to find his salvation in it, his anguish will continue unabated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is ultimately this: Will he offer himself as a voluntary sacrifice to the will of God? &amp;hellip;He must accept as his own will, as his own desire, the will of God for his life. If this happens, he will cease being anxious about his sufferings, for he will see that they too are the signs and tokens of God&amp;rsquo;s presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~Archimandrite Aimilianos, Psalms and the Life of Faith, p. 100-102.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today in church I prostrated myself, whuch is to say I bowed deeply, with knees and forehead touching the floor, to my spiritual fathers and to every single other person present, and asked forgiveness for the things I have done that caused them offense. And they in turn asked me. The little kids. The old folks. My personal friends, and people to whom I&amp;rsquo;ve never spoken a word. We forgave each other, and reminded each other that God forgives. Forgiveness is important, says my spiritual father, but change is more important. Am I changed today? Are you? Are you trying? People change, but not everything. Sometimes the changes are big and important, other times more like storms or fluctuations. When you love a person, you learn to accept those things. Forgiveness is unbroken love in the face of such changes. Love grows, and growth is change, too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some techno-gibberish: forestry.io offers a free CMS service that integrates with Hugo, the tool I use to generate the site. What that means is that I can now update the site from my iPhone üì±!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that&amp;rsquo;ll allow me to do something from time to time that I&amp;rsquo;ve never done here before ‚Äî real-time site updates. Capture some things in the moment before they&amp;rsquo;re lost to time and fleeting attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrate with me by dancing to this song.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a couple of site updates yesterday I wanted to mention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, if you click on the logo image, you&amp;rsquo;ll be taken back to the home page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fixed the stylesheets for mobile devices so that the photoblog image previews work a little better and appear more consistent between small screen and large screen devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to click on the title of a photoblog (like the recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/photos/2019-02-26-lax-international-terminal/&#34;&gt;Scenes from the LAX International Terminal&lt;/a&gt;) to see the full set of photos. You can click on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/photos/&#34;&gt;Photos&lt;/a&gt; link at the top of the site to see all my photoblogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site actually looks great on mobile. I think I prefer it that way. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;üë®üèª‚Äçüíªüõ†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a quick site update ‚Äî you can now leave comments! I had that feature back in the old days of the blog, and am only now getting around to adding it back. Hopefully it doesn&amp;rsquo;t drag the page load time down too much. Since the internal URLs for all the articles changed after I migrated the site, I unfortunately lost all those old comments. So leave me some new ones if you feel it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I think all the Flickr embeds are fixed. At least I haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed any more issues.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;To those who may still occasionally haunt this site, this is a reminder that it&amp;rsquo;s not forgotten, just long neglected. It looks like there may some sort of problem with my Flickr embeds. I will work on repairing those shortly, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do we go from here? That&amp;rsquo;s a question I ask myself frequently with regards to this blog. Has it lived its good life for me, and now expired?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more so I think I am waiting for a new inspiration, a new life. With friends and loves both new and old to share it with. There are so many things yet to show, and say. Things fantastic, and many things mundane. Why not let there be some outlet, don&amp;rsquo;t you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the kid was watching an episode of the old Ghostbusters cartoon from the 80s, his new favorite on Netflix. The show featured the three Fates, and a journey to the Underworld, crossing the river Styx, etc. I said to him &amp;ldquo;Did you know this is Greek mythology? These were things the ancient Greeks believed.&amp;rdquo; He looked at me incredulously for a second and asked &amp;ldquo;They believed in the Ghostbusters?&amp;rdquo; ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a good Dad laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-death-of-ivan-ilyich-leo-tolstoy-chapter-xii&#34;&gt;The Death of Ivan Ilyich, Leo Tolstoy. Chapter XII&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that moment the screaming began that continued for three days, and was so terrible that one could not hear it through two closed doors without horror. At the moment he answered his wife he realized that he was lost, that there was no return, that the end had come, the very end, and his doubts were still unsolved and remained doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&amp;rdquo; he cried in various intonations. He had begun by screaming &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t!&amp;rdquo; and continued screaming on the letter &amp;ldquo;O&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For three whole days, during which time did not exist for him, he struggled in that black sack into which he was being thrust by an invisible, resistless force. He struggled as a man condemned to death struggles in the hands of the executioner, knowing that he cannot save himself. And every moment he felt that despite all his efforts he was drawing nearer and nearer to what terrified him. He felt that his agony was due to his being thrust into that black hole and still more to his not being able to get right into it. He was hindered from getting into it by his conviction that his life had been a good one. That very justification of his life held him fast and prevented his moving forward, and it caused him most torment of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly some force struck him in the chest and side, making it still harder to breathe, and he fell through the hole and there at the bottom was a light. What had happened to him was like the sensation one sometimes experiences in a railway carriage when one thinks one is going backwards while one is really going forwards and suddenly becomes aware of the real direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, it was not the right thing,&amp;rdquo; he said to himself, &amp;ldquo;but that&amp;rsquo;s no matter. It can be done. But what is the right thing? he asked himself, and suddenly grew quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This occurred at the end of the third day, two hours before his death. Just then his schoolboy son had crept softly in and gone up to the bedside. The dying man was still screaming desperately and waving his arms. His hand fell on the boy&amp;rsquo;s head, and the boy caught it, pressed it to his lips, and began to cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that very moment Ivan Ilych fell through and caught sight of the light, and it was revealed to him that though his life had not been what it should have been, this could still be rectified. He asked himself, &amp;ldquo;What is the right thing?&amp;rdquo; and grew still, listening. Then he felt that someone was kissing his hand. He opened his eyes, looked at his son, and felt sorry for him. His wife came up to him and he glanced at her. She was gazing at him open-mouthed, with undried tears on her nose and cheek and a despairing look on her face. He felt sorry for her too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, I am making them wretched,&amp;rdquo; he thought. &amp;ldquo;They are sorry, but it will be better for them when I die.&amp;rdquo; He wished to say this but had not the strength to utter it. &amp;ldquo;Besides, why speak? I must act,&amp;rdquo; he thought. with a look at his wife he indicated his son and said: &amp;ldquo;Take him away&amp;hellip;sorry for him&amp;hellip;sorry for you too&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo; He tried to add, &amp;ldquo;Forgive me,&amp;rdquo; but said &amp;ldquo;Forego&amp;rdquo; and waved his hand, knowing that He whose understanding mattered would understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And suddenly it grew clear to him that what had been oppressing him and would not leave him was all dropping away at once from two sides, from ten sides, and from all sides. He was sorry for them, he must act so as not to hurt them: release them and free himself from these sufferings. &amp;ldquo;How good and how simple!&amp;rdquo; he thought. &amp;ldquo;And the pain?&amp;rdquo; he asked himself. &amp;ldquo;What has become of it? Where are you, pain?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned his attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, here it is. Well, what of it? Let the pain be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And death&amp;hellip;where is it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sought his former accustomed fear of death and did not find it. &amp;ldquo;Where is it? What death?&amp;rdquo; There was no fear because there was no death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In place of death there was light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So that&amp;rsquo;s what it is!&amp;rdquo; he suddenly exclaimed aloud. &amp;ldquo;What joy!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To him all this happened in a single instant, and the meaning of that instant did not change. For those present his agony continued for another two hours. Something rattled in his throat, his emaciated body twitched, then the gasping and rattle became less and less frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is finished!&amp;rdquo; said someone near him. He heard these words and repeated them in his soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Death is finished,&amp;rdquo; he said to himself. &amp;ldquo;It is no more!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He drew in a breath, stopped in the midst of a sigh, stretched out, and died.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Andy Griffith Show is one of those rare cultural phenomena that have spanned generations and left an indelible mark on American pop culture. Deputy Barney Fife consistently ranks among the top tier of American television characters on all polls, placing at number five in The &lt;a href=&#34;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-12-06/features/9512060169_1_lucy-ricardo-ted-baxter-tv-characters&#34;&gt;Chicago Tribune&amp;rsquo;s list of the top 25&lt;/a&gt; of all time. (I would enthusiastically dispute that either Eddie Haskell or Ed Norton belong on that list above him.) Not only are the characters still beloved and recognizable more than fifty years on from their debut on the small screen, but the whole fictional world of Mayberry has transcended that medium to become a part of the national mythology ‚Äî a kind of idyllic (and idealized) portrait of the last days of small town life in post-war America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the history of sitcoms, there have been three great formative epochs, possibly four, defined by shows that broke new ground comedically and developed formulas that inspired and informed not only other TV shows of their time, but also the national consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Andy Griffith Show&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All in the Family, or The Norman Lear Era&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Office, or The Post-Seinfeld Era&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Lear wrote in his autobiography that the social and political consciousness of All in the Family was a direct reaction against the implied conservatism of programs like The Andy Griffith Show, a view which fans familiar with the entire run of the series could find some reason to dispute. He would succeed over the next 15 years to change the face and nature of television comedy as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The influence of The Andy Griffith Show on Seinfeld is indisputable. Larry David confessed himself to be a great fan of the show, and although never acknowledged it can be seen that a large number of Seinfeld episodes drew major story and plot details from episodes of The Andy Griffith Show. A direct show by show analysis is in order. I have not been able to find such a thing on the internet. I may take the time to do that someday for this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, when I ran across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metv.com/lists/here-are-a-dozen-rap-songs-that-referenced-andy-griffith&#34;&gt;this bit of clickbait&lt;/a&gt; today, I had to read the article. And sure enough, The Andy Griffith Show has permeated the national consciousness to such a strong degree that generations later Andy, Barney, Opie, and even Otis have all found their way into the world of rap and hip-hop music, all the way through recent years. It&amp;rsquo;s a credit the to the enduring and universal appeal, and even the love that people have, of a truly exceptional program.&lt;/p&gt;
