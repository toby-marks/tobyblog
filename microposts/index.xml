        <description>&lt;p&gt;The soul has to make a choice, and the outcome will either break it into pieces or enable it to sail to its destination in God. And the choice comes down to this: Will the soul accept or reject suffering? Will it make this suffering its own, or struggle against it, seeing it as something alien to itself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;If he chooses to accept his suffering, he must embrace it with the wholeness of his life; he must discover and accept the proper relation to his suffering. If he can do this, he will have transformed his suffering so that in the end his only reality will be God. But if he continues to resist his suffering, refusing to find his salvation in it, his anguish will continue unabated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is ultimately this: Will he offer himself as a voluntary sacrifice to the will of God? &amp;hellip;He must accept as his own will, as his own desire, the will of God for his life. If this happens, he will cease being anxious about his sufferings, for he will see that they too are the signs and tokens of God&amp;rsquo;s presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~Archimandrite Aimilianos, Psalms and the Life of Faith, p. 100-102.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The smell of rotting pumpkin is worse than dead bodies. Ah, from what I‚Äôve heard&amp;hellip; We had one survive till now, though, and I‚Äôm thinking about making a St. Patty‚Äôs day carving. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs a wrap for this trip. It‚Äôs been fun trying a new hotel and exploring a different part of the city. Perhaps next time I‚Äôll try to take in more of the cultural life. There‚Äôs always something going on in Pasadena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now home again to Texas and the people I love. See you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just smelled fresh mulch for the first time this year. Pungent, warm, green. I could feel the natural heat of it as they scooped it off the back of a flatbed as I walked by on the street.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve received some very nice compliments while I‚Äôve been here this week. It‚Äôs always great to get positive feedback for the work you put in. It makes a big difference in your day. üë®üèª‚Äçüíªü¶∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope your day is going well, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting things you run across when you decide to walk the mile and a half back to the hotel instead of Uber-ing. This is an old Methodist Church in the Playhouse District of Pasadena. Almost looks like an entrance to another world. A secret garden. A little foreboding perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lot about this area I‚Äôd like to explore. I‚Äôll be back again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see what you did there, Flattery. And for the moderately bosomed woman? Out of luck, I suppose‚Ä¶ üëô&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>http://tobyblog.com/microposts/forgiveness-sunday/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today in church I prostrated myself, whuch is to say I bowed deeply, with knees and forehead touching the floor, to my spiritual fathers and to every single other person present, and asked forgiveness for the things I have done that caused them offense. And they in turn asked me. The little kids. The old folks. My personal friends, and people to whom I&amp;rsquo;ve never spoken a word. We forgave each other, and reminded each other that God forgives. Forgiveness is important, says my spiritual father, but change is more important. Am I changed today? Are you? Are you trying? People change, but not everything. Sometimes the changes are big and important, other times more like storms or fluctuations. When you love a person, you learn to accept those things. Forgiveness is unbroken love in the face of such changes. Love grows, and growth is change, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy springtime to all you players out there. The weather‚Äôs warming up here in Texas. We‚Äôre coming out of winter. I think we‚Äôre through the worst of it. Are you looking for signs of new growth? Look to the trees! They‚Äôre always the first to show.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some techno-gibberish: forestry.io offers a free CMS service that integrates with Hugo, the tool I use to generate the site. What that means is that I can now update the site from my iPhone üì±!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that&amp;rsquo;ll allow me to do something from time to time that I&amp;rsquo;ve never done here before ‚Äî real-time site updates. Capture some things in the moment before they&amp;rsquo;re lost to time and fleeting attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrate with me by dancing to this song.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had this song stuck in my head for a couple of days, and maybe if I post it I can get rid of it. It&amp;rsquo;s from The Jerk, and features Bernadette Peters, my first screen crush when I was just a little kid. That bit at the end where she pulls out the coronet still cracks me up. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s a touching scene, don&amp;rsquo;t you think? A little reminder that life can be sweet sometimes.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Infexxion is an iPhone game based on the old arcade game &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxx&#34;&gt;Attax&lt;/a&gt;. My cousin Carl introduced me to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-CTpCD-CNc&#34;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;. There was a cabinet in the lobby of a (surely long-since demolished?) movie theater in what is now a rough part of Lafayette, Louisiana. I forget what we were seeing that night. He played ‚Äî I didn&amp;rsquo;t, as I recall. It had a weird, edgy kind of quality to it, like an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7SbD_TUu3A&#34;&gt;Exidy game&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s addictive. The only place I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it since is &lt;a href=&#34;http://freeplayrichardson.com/&#34;&gt;Freeplay Arcade&lt;/a&gt; in Richardson, Texas, where if you can beat the final &amp;ldquo;boss&amp;rdquo; AI, you get a free beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One&lt;/em&gt; time, just a few weeks after discovering Infexxion, I scored a 40. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing that game for over a year now. In all that time, I have never matched or beaten that score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a single time.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a couple of site updates yesterday I wanted to mention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, if you click on the logo image, you&amp;rsquo;ll be taken back to the home page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fixed the stylesheets for mobile devices so that the photoblog image previews work a little better and appear more consistent between small screen and large screen devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to click on the title of a photoblog (like the recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/photos/2019-02-26-lax-international-terminal/&#34;&gt;Scenes from the LAX International Terminal&lt;/a&gt;) to see the full set of photos. You can click on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/photos/&#34;&gt;Photos&lt;/a&gt; link at the top of the site to see all my photoblogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site actually looks great on mobile. I think I prefer it that way. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Sonic the Hedgehog movie comes out this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you hyped, nostalgia boys?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if you look at this poster and get hyped, I&amp;rsquo;m calling the cops. Seriously, who designed this freakish movie poster and why is he/she not in jail/hell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/sonic_movie.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Augie poses in front of the somewhat perverted poster for the Sonic the Hedgehog movie&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;üë®üèª‚Äçüíªüõ†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a quick site update ‚Äî you can now leave comments! I had that feature back in the old days of the blog, and am only now getting around to adding it back. Hopefully it doesn&amp;rsquo;t drag the page load time down too much. Since the internal URLs for all the articles changed after I migrated the site, I unfortunately lost all those old comments. So leave me some new ones if you feel it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I think all the Flickr embeds are fixed. At least I haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed any more issues.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;To those who may still occasionally haunt this site, this is a reminder that it&amp;rsquo;s not forgotten, just long neglected. It looks like there may some sort of problem with my Flickr embeds. I will work on repairing those shortly, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where do we go from here? That&amp;rsquo;s a question I ask myself frequently with regards to this blog. Has it lived its good life for me, and now expired?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more so I think I am waiting for a new inspiration, a new life. With friends and loves both new and old to share it with. There are so many things yet to show, and say. Things fantastic, and many things mundane. Why not let there be some outlet, don&amp;rsquo;t you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the kid was watching an episode of the old Ghostbusters cartoon from the 80s, his new favorite on Netflix. The show featured the three Fates, and a journey to the Underworld, crossing the river Styx, etc. I said to him &amp;ldquo;Did you know this is Greek mythology? These were things the ancient Greeks believed.&amp;rdquo; He looked at me incredulously for a second and asked &amp;ldquo;They believed in the Ghostbusters?&amp;rdquo; ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a good Dad laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-death-of-ivan-ilyich-leo-tolstoy-chapter-xii&#34;&gt;The Death of Ivan Ilyich, Leo Tolstoy. Chapter XII&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that moment the screaming began that continued for three days, and was so terrible that one could not hear it through two closed doors without horror. At the moment he answered his wife he realized that he was lost, that there was no return, that the end had come, the very end, and his doubts were still unsolved and remained doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&amp;rdquo; he cried in various intonations. He had begun by screaming &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t!&amp;rdquo; and continued screaming on the letter &amp;ldquo;O&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For three whole days, during which time did not exist for him, he struggled in that black sack into which he was being thrust by an invisible, resistless force. He struggled as a man condemned to death struggles in the hands of the executioner, knowing that he cannot save himself. And every moment he felt that despite all his efforts he was drawing nearer and nearer to what terrified him. He felt that his agony was due to his being thrust into that black hole and still more to his not being able to get right into it. He was hindered from getting into it by his conviction that his life had been a good one. That very justification of his life held him fast and prevented his moving forward, and it caused him most torment of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly some force struck him in the chest and side, making it still harder to breathe, and he fell through the hole and there at the bottom was a light. What had happened to him was like the sensation one sometimes experiences in a railway carriage when one thinks one is going backwards while one is really going forwards and suddenly becomes aware of the real direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, it was not the right thing,&amp;rdquo; he said to himself, &amp;ldquo;but that&amp;rsquo;s no matter. It can be done. But what is the right thing? he asked himself, and suddenly grew quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This occurred at the end of the third day, two hours before his death. Just then his schoolboy son had crept softly in and gone up to the bedside. The dying man was still screaming desperately and waving his arms. His hand fell on the boy&amp;rsquo;s head, and the boy caught it, pressed it to his lips, and began to cry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that very moment Ivan Ilych fell through and caught sight of the light, and it was revealed to him that though his life had not been what it should have been, this could still be rectified. He asked himself, &amp;ldquo;What is the right thing?&amp;rdquo; and grew still, listening. Then he felt that someone was kissing his hand. He opened his eyes, looked at his son, and felt sorry for him. His wife came up to him and he glanced at her. She was gazing at him open-mouthed, with undried tears on her nose and cheek and a despairing look on her face. He felt sorry for her too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, I am making them wretched,&amp;rdquo; he thought. &amp;ldquo;They are sorry, but it will be better for them when I die.&amp;rdquo; He wished to say this but had not the strength to utter it. &amp;ldquo;Besides, why speak? I must act,&amp;rdquo; he thought. with a look at his wife he indicated his son and said: &amp;ldquo;Take him away&amp;hellip;sorry for him&amp;hellip;sorry for you too&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo; He tried to add, &amp;ldquo;Forgive me,&amp;rdquo; but said &amp;ldquo;Forego&amp;rdquo; and waved his hand, knowing that He whose understanding mattered would understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And suddenly it grew clear to him that what had been oppressing him and would not leave him was all dropping away at once from two sides, from ten sides, and from all sides. He was sorry for them, he must act so as not to hurt them: release them and free himself from these sufferings. &amp;ldquo;How good and how simple!&amp;rdquo; he thought. &amp;ldquo;And the pain?&amp;rdquo; he asked himself. &amp;ldquo;What has become of it? Where are you, pain?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned his attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes, here it is. Well, what of it? Let the pain be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And death&amp;hellip;where is it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sought his former accustomed fear of death and did not find it. &amp;ldquo;Where is it? What death?&amp;rdquo; There was no fear because there was no death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In place of death there was light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So that&amp;rsquo;s what it is!&amp;rdquo; he suddenly exclaimed aloud. &amp;ldquo;What joy!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To him all this happened in a single instant, and the meaning of that instant did not change. For those present his agony continued for another two hours. Something rattled in his throat, his emaciated body twitched, then the gasping and rattle became less and less frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is finished!&amp;rdquo; said someone near him. He heard these words and repeated them in his soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Death is finished,&amp;rdquo; he said to himself. &amp;ldquo;It is no more!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He drew in a breath, stopped in the midst of a sigh, stretched out, and died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;i-think-i-just-found-my-halloween-costume-for-this-year&#34;&gt;I think I just found my Halloween costume for this year.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I ever miss this? It debuted just last year for the 40th anniversary celebration of Frank Zappa&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjL2sRX78DM&amp;amp;list=PLLxVHLcTJJQuzuA5VYgYxUQB3WnZen8sF&#34;&gt;legendary Halloween concert series at The Palladium in New York&lt;/a&gt;. Zappa did Halloween concerts throughout the entirety of his career, but the one in 1977 is generally considered to be the apogee of that grand tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To commemorate that series of shows (which ran from October 28-31), &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zappa.com/news/halloween-77-box-set-celebrates-historic-concert-runs-40th-anniversary-october-20&#34;&gt;the family released a massive box set&lt;/a&gt; that includes all six concerts on a USB stick, in 24-bit WAV audio for a flawless sound experience, PLUS a jaw-dropping adult size Frank Zappa costume in vintage 70s plastic style. Worth every penny, and still &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.walmart.com/ip/Halloween-77-Limited-Edition/389476830?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;amp;selectedSellerId=4115&amp;amp;adid=22222222227123273768&amp;amp;wl0=&amp;amp;wl1=g&amp;amp;wl2=c&amp;amp;wl3=234249714372&amp;amp;wl4=pla-385955699003&amp;amp;wl5=9026811&amp;amp;wl6=&amp;amp;wl7=&amp;amp;wl8=&amp;amp;wl9=pla&amp;amp;wl10=115794308&amp;amp;wl11=online&amp;amp;wl12=389476830&amp;amp;wl13=&amp;amp;veh=sem&#34;&gt;available from Walmart for around 80 bucks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-andy-griffith-show-is-one-of-those-rare-cultural-phenomena&#34;&gt;The Andy Griffith Show is one of those rare cultural phenomena&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶that have spanned generations and left an indelible mark on American pop culture. Deputy Barney Fife consistently ranks among the top tier of American television characters on all polls, placing at number five in The &lt;a href=&#34;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-12-06/features/9512060169_1_lucy-ricardo-ted-baxter-tv-characters&#34;&gt;Chicago Tribune&amp;rsquo;s list of the top 25&lt;/a&gt; of all time. (I would enthusiastically dispute that either Eddie Haskell or Ed Norton belong on that list above him.) Not only are the characters still beloved and recognizable more than fifty years on from their debut on the small screen, but the whole fictional world of Mayberry has transcended that medium to become a part of the national mythology ‚Äî a kind of idyllic (and idealized) portrait of the last days of small town life in post-war America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the history of sitcoms, there have been three great formative epochs, possibly four, defined by shows that broke new ground comedically and developed formulas that inspired and informed not only other TV shows of their time, but also the national consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Andy Griffith Show&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All in the Family, or The Norman Lear Era&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Office, or The Post-Seinfeld Era&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman Lear wrote in his autobiography that the social and political consciousness of All in the Family was a direct reaction against the implied conservatism of programs like The Andy Griffith Show, a view which fans familiar with the entire run of the series could find some reason to dispute. He would succeed over the next 15 years to change the face and nature of television comedy as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The influence of The Andy Griffith Show on Seinfeld is indisputable. Larry David confessed himself to be a great fan of the show, and although never acknowledged it can be seen that a large number of Seinfeld episodes drew major story and plot details from episodes of The Andy Griffith Show. A direct show by show analysis is in order. I have not been able to find such a thing on the internet. I may take the time to do that someday for this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, when I ran across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metv.com/lists/here-are-a-dozen-rap-songs-that-referenced-andy-griffith&#34;&gt;this bit of clickbait&lt;/a&gt; today, I had to read the article. And sure enough, The Andy Griffith Show has permeated the national consciousness to such a strong degree that generations later Andy, Barney, Opie, and even Otis have all found their way into the world of rap and hip-hop music, all the way through recent years. It&amp;rsquo;s a credit the to the enduring and universal appeal, and even the love that people have, of a truly exceptional program.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I mowed the back yard for the first time this spring. I am behind. The weather and other duties had kept me off task. The grass was high, and each square foot I tread into submission was like a territory reclaimed for civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked myself when people started doing this whole thing. Exactly how old is the time honored American activity of mowing the lawn? And why is this mundane chore, as therapeutic and contemplative as it is, not shown more love by those in the Big Nostalgia set, so connected as it is to real childhood and adolescent memory? Where does it all come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makes me wonder what a Toby looks like. Today, too sick to care.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Being sick on a trip is the worst. I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been sleeping every spare moment I get. Managed to catch a pretty decent cheese ball of a movie, though. It was old school campy fun in the best way. Nicely captured the feel of old 80s schlock-horror movies like &lt;em&gt;The Gate&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Return of the Living Dead&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
