<title>All New Photo Galleries  |  ~ The Tobyblog üìù</title>
<meta name="description" content="The personal blog and home page of one of the web&#39;s many Tobys. What distinguishes me is that I own the domain. To you I say welcome(!) in the grand old tradition of proto-websites of the nineties. The place where I deposit the overflow of my time, mind, and labors, Tobyblog is my refuge from the coming social media apocalypse.">

  <meta property="og:description" content="It took a bit of effort to get everything tweaked just right for mobile, but I‚Äôm happy to announce that I‚Äôve upgraded my photo galleries to use the popular ‚Äúlightbox‚Äù style layout. There‚Äôs of course some Javascript overhead that I regret, but I think that‚Äôs offset somewhat by lazy loading and the use of thumbnails. See whether you think response time has improved. It‚Äôs not everywhere yet, just on recent galleries like Flight to LA and probably all stuff going forward from that, unless I‚Äôm posting from my phone. The old stuff should work the same. Best experienced on a laptop or desktop, of course, where you get the nice grid layout with all the thumbnails. I like that you can get a real sense of everything all at once, and then start exploring where you wish, vs being forced to scroll past photos in order to take everything in. Hopefully that leads to a more intentional viewing experience. Enjoy.">
