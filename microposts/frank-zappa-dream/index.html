<title>A Dream About Frank Zappa  |  ~ The Tobyblog üìù</title>
<meta name="description" content="The personal blog and home page of one of the web&#39;s many Tobys. What distinguishes me is that I own the domain. To you I say welcome(!) in the grand old tradition of proto-websites of the nineties. The place where I deposit the overflow of my time, mind, and labors, Tobyblog is my refuge from the coming social media apocalypse.">

  <meta property="og:description" content="A Dream About Frank Zappa Last night I dreamed I was at a private concert with Frank Zappa, and he was showing me this new kind of instrument he had (in the afterlife?) It was something like a tall grayish-silver cone, about the height and thickness of a man, having many sides like a dodecahedron, but twisted in a slight spiral that got tighter towards the top. Down the sides ran these buttons, each labeled with a flat black symbol representing a different musical instrument. He could play these by pointing to the button with a short metal wand or rod, and running his fingers along the sides. He told me it could reproduce the sound of any instrument or whatever sound he wanted. He played some of his old stuff on it to demonstrate.">
