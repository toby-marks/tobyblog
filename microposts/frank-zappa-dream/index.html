<p>Last night I dreamed I was at a private concert with Frank Zappa, and he was showing me this new kind of instrument he had (in the afterlife?) It was something like a tall grayish-silver cone, about the height and thickness of a man, having many sides like a dodecahedron, but twisted in a slight spiral that got tighter towards the top. Down the sides ran these buttons, each labeled with a flat black symbol representing a different musical instrument. He could play these by pointing to the button with a short metal wand or rod, and running his fingers along the sides. He told me it could reproduce the sound of any instrument or whatever sound he wanted. He played some of his old stuff on it to demonstrate.</p>
