<title>Problems with Flickr?  |  ~ The Tobyblog üìù</title>
<meta name="description" content="The personal blog and home page of one of the web&#39;s many Tobys. What distinguishes me is that I own the domain. To you I say welcome(!) in the grand old tradition of proto-websites of the nineties. The place where I deposit the overflow of my time, mind, and labors, Tobyblog is my refuge from the coming social media apocalypse.">

<p>Where do we go from here? That&rsquo;s a question I ask myself frequently with regards to this blog. Has it lived its good life for me, and now expired?</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>But more so I think I am waiting for a new inspiration, a new life. With friends and loves both new and old to share it with. There are so many things yet to show, and say. Things fantastic, and many things mundane. Why not let there be some outlet, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>Why not.</p>
