<title>Leaving On A Jetplane  |  ~ The Tobyblog 📝</title>
<meta name="description" content="The personal blog and home page of one of the web&#39;s many Tobys. What distinguishes me is that I own the domain. To you I say welcome(!) in the grand old tradition of proto-websites of the nineties. The place where I deposit the overflow of my time, mind, and labors, Tobyblog is my refuge from the coming social media apocalypse.">

Well, it’s been a busy few days. It’s a lot of work graduating a kid. Between that and home and my professional duties I’ve been swamped. Such is the life of a dad. Since my last teaser post it’s only now that I feel like I can catch my breath a bit and recollect on some things I’d like to share with you.
Hope you all are having a warm and magical evening.">
