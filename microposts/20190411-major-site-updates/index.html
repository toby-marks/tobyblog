<title>🛠 Major Site Updates 👨🏻‍💻  |  ~ The Tobyblog 📝</title>
<meta name="description" content="The personal blog and home page of one of the web&#39;s many Tobys. What distinguishes me is that I own the domain. To you I say welcome(!) in the grand old tradition of proto-websites of the nineties. The place where I deposit the overflow of my time, mind, and labors, Tobyblog is my refuge from the coming social media apocalypse.">

  <meta property="og:description" content="🛠👨🏻‍💻 Major site updates! A lot of you might not be aware that in years past I made a lot of videos for the site. You’ll now notice a Videos tab up at the top to make it easy to find those. Also, I’ve settled on how I’m going to use the Microposts feature of blog, which mainly I’ll reserve for short text-only updates like these, or short Tweet-like content. As a result, I moved a lot of my Microposts for this year under Posts, which as an added benefit will allow you to comment on my photoblog stuff. Have fun poking around.">
