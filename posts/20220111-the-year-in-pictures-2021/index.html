<p>The general consensus is that all time, day, and season since the announcement of the pandemic and the beginning of &ldquo;these unprecedented times&rdquo; has flowed together, coagulating into a formless lump of frustrated expectation. The expectation is that life will at any point now return to normal, or at least how we thought of that word prior to March 2020, when it seems that the powers of the world at last conspired to draw their net around the mass of us privileged, who up until that point had managed to eke out our lives in this place without more than the ordinary lot of troubles, looking on more or less helplessly as the &ldquo;others&rdquo; of the world suffered for our comfort, and perhaps, in our place.</p>
<p>But normal is one of those words whose meaning seems to fall apart upon close examination. It&rsquo;s certainly not a universal condition. It can be understood only in a vague sense when conveyed to others. It is transitory. And how much of what we tell ourselves anyway is clouded by our own needful illusions or willful blindness? Did we ever understand what normal was? To anyone who has been paying attention the current situation, though highly abnormal, surely can be explained, even expected. Is it normal to think that we can go about living as we do, from day to day, forever without encountering any challenges to that life? To our assumptions? To our convictions?</p>
<p>It is in these times that we find out who we are. How to live. What to value. We look at things afresh. The normal takes on new meaning. Amid all these constant changes we continue to look for the light, to change our perspective, and wait for the perfect moment to‚Ä¶¬†act, to snap that photo.</p>
<p>Do you see what I did there? I brought it all back to photography. I&rsquo;m a good writer.</p>
<p>Anyways, it&rsquo;s that time again, so enjoy this collection of my favorite photos from the year just past. We took a really lovely and memorable trip to Sedona in the spring, and I believe I added several to my collection of personal best photos from our local area.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
