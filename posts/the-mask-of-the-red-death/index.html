The &lsquo;Red Death&rsquo; had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal — the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution.

<p>The &lsquo;Red Death&rsquo; had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal — the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All these and security were within. Without was the &ldquo;Red Death.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>His vesture was dabbled in <em>blood</em> — and his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.</p>
