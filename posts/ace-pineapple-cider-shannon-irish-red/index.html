A very sophisticated look, like a nice champagne. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It was every bit as light and crisp as you would expect from a good cider. This one is best served served cold. But no cloying sweetness. The flavor was delicate, in no way overwhelming. You got the essence of pineapple without the punch, an effect that was accentuated by the mild carbonation. It was a good thirst-quencher of a cider for a hot early-evening.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Shannon red I picked up mostly because of the pretty can. On the back it says that you're supposed to get aromatic hints of raisin bread, but I wasn't able to detect that.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It had great color in the glass, particularly with a little light behind it. That's my favorite thing about reds. The head was a little on the thin side.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The taste, however, would make it welcome on my dinner table anytime. Just the slightest sweetness (maybe that's the raisin bread?) balanced out the hoppy bitterness. I wouldn't call it an outstanding beer, but it's a good, comfortable solid one that I will buy again.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Happy summer!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
