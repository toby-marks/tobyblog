<p>Contrast that, for instance, this supposed actual recording of mall music from 1974, sounds I might have been more personally familiar with. Surely the recording is busted, or maybe this counts as a piece of experimental music. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend listening to this for long periods of time as the warbly, dreary sounds can lull you into a weird, trance-like stupor.</p>
<p>Or maybe you like that kind of thing.</p>

<p>The opening ballad-like anthem on this Kmart track tells you just how popular and influential the Carpenters must have been in the early 70s. The rest is a pretty cool nostalgia trip for the ears. Impressed with the bold logo on the television screen as I was listening to this stuff in the background, my kid asked me about Kmart and it got us to talking about old department stores of that era. Before I knew it, and as we were talking, he had built a little Kmart playset for his robots. I enjoyed that very much.</p>
<p>Happy Black Friday to all!</p>
