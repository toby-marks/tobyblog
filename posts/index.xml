      <title>The Year in Pictures ‚Äî 2020 Edition</title>

      <description>This year was different.
News of the virus in China had already begun to circulate late last year. The videos and stories coming out of Wuhan were quite terrifying. People being welded into their apartments to prevent them from leaving. Bodies being secretly cremated en masse by the authorities. Sick people being burned alive. You have to wonder now if any of that had any basis in reality. I have come to distrust the news, both mainstream and alternative.</description>

      <description>Damn you, covid. And damn the lockdowns.
Small businesses are an unaccounted for casualty of 2020. The vast majority cannot survive indefinite periods of marginal revenue due to generalized fear or service restrictions. The money that would have gone to them are instead funneled to large businesses and the mega-rich like Bezos. At least there has been some kickback with regards to people being put out of their homes because of an inability to pay rent (and that may change).</description>

      <description>Forever remind yourself.
  The comments section on this video describes it as 70&amp;rsquo;s Italian cocaine lounge music. Psychedelia. Dunno, but I like it. I suppose this goes out to all you folks tripping today in Oregon.</description>

      <description>This is the guy that taught me and Kass to appreciate jazz, literally. He was our old jazz and music appreciation professor in college. On a couple of occasions we went to see him and his band play around town. Neat guy, and some people said we kind of resembled each other.
I always found this sound makes for good study music. This is his third album, I believe, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty strong.</description>

      <description>Currently enjoying this sweet cover of one of my favorite Blossom Dearie tracks. That&amp;rsquo;s not the only Blossom Dearie song they cover, too. Apparently somebody over there is a fan.
If there were more covers of her music I&amp;rsquo;d love to do another cover battle, but alas. Blossom is too much underappreciated.

&lt;p&gt;Yes, not even the age of corona, one that has sadly seen the shuttering of many beloved local institutions, can stop the juggernaut of recycled dreams that is Dallas Vintage Toys. After a frightening and disorienting two week shutdown, the doors are open once agains to kids and adult collectors alike. And in a spirit of bold defiance to these unprecedented times(tm), they&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tripled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the floor space and inventory, and dammit they even installed a big old Castle Grayskull facade for your Instagramming pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new normal is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;old toys!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;One night each week he was allowed to leave his father, his mother, and his younger brother Tom asleep in their small house next door and run here, up the dark spiral stairs to his grandparents&#39; cupola, and in this sorcerer&amp;rsquo;s tower sleep with thunders and visions, to wake befor the crystal jingle of milk bottles and perform his ritual magic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I try to get out for a walk every day. I think it&amp;rsquo;s done a great deal to help maintain peace of mind, a sense of time, and a connection with my local environment. Sometimes, though, I&amp;rsquo;d like to venture a little further abroad and take in more than just the local sights. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had opportunity to do any really serious hiking like this. I wonder how long it would take to train for a five-month hike.</description>

      <title>Dandelion Wine ‚Äî A Book for Summer</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you have here in this book then is a gathering of dandelions from all those years. The wine metaphor which appears again and again in these pages is wonderfully apt. I was gathering images all of my life, storing them away, and forgetting them. Somehow I had to send myself back, with words as catalysts to open the memories out and see what they had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray Bradbury, Just This Side of Byzantium ‚Äî An Introduction, Dandelion Wine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer doesn&amp;rsquo;t officially arrive for a while, but after an hour out in the Texas sun on my quarantine walk, you can start to feel the sweat pooling around your neck and dripping down your scalp. I saw somebody on Twitter recommending this as a good time to start reading (or re-reading) Ray Bradbury&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dandelion Wine.&lt;/em&gt; Why not?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tia Lupita is Literal Awesome Sauce</title>

      <description>Of the craft sauces listed in the article, I can personally vouch for Tia Lupita (red, not the salsa verde) and pretty much all of the Yellowbird sauces from Austin. The thing that really sets Tia Lupita apart its strong cumin-y flavor, which I happen to love. That stuff is really great on eggs, but honestly goes with almost everything.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs not a contest but every generation has to confront its own evil because there is something deeply wrong with human beings.
 The reason for the existence of shows like Hunters is the same reason why Godwin had to come up with his &amp;ldquo;Law.&amp;quot; And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to do with the laziness of screenwriters, though that does play into it. In the absence of religious faith Hitler and the Nazis have taken the place of the devil in our collective mythology.</description>

      <description>Since the coronavirus started spreading, our little computer and phone cameras have become the windows of our isolation, looking into other people‚Äôs lives, catching glimpses of pets, children, and spouses in the background of video calls. I find these moments deeply humanizing; reminders that we‚Äôre not perfect work machines, just people trying to do the best we can. Our hair is messy, our faces poorly framed and lit. Sometimes we leave the mic on when we go to the bathroom.</description>

I tell you, fans, I could not be more ready to reintroduce cheese into my diet.
  Haters be silent. Cheese in ramen is a cheap American innovation, granted, but ramen is nothing if not versatile and accommodating.</description>

      <description>I suppose it can&amp;rsquo;t be helped; every year as March drags into April, as the days get hotter and the brief Texas spring looks more toward the summer, the early zeal of the Lenten discipline wears off, and the sacrifices once willingly undertaken become an annoyance and a burden. These things are only compounded by the enforced isolation and the looming prospect of an almost anti-climatic, if not mildly depressing, Pascha undertaken as it is this year without the usual joy of communal celebration.</description>

Great timing on my part. Maybe he didn&amp;rsquo;t follow soon enough the sober and thoughtful advice given in this video.
Get well, my brother.

      <description>Just got this from my brother, who at this moment is being hospitalized in Louisiana for pneumonia and possible coronavirus infection. Still awaiting results of his 2nd test. Hasn&amp;rsquo;t killed his sense of humor. We love you, Josh. Get well.

      <description>A traditional Irish dinner. Corned beef and cabbage and Saldo. (Well maybe not that last bit&amp;hellip;)
Yes, it‚Äôs a cheat during Great Lent. But it‚Äôs also a long established family tradition. And St. Patrick is a special patron of ours.
For dessert, s‚Äômores over the stove, as we missed our chance for brownies today, and I neglected to hoard ice cream during the quarantine. No matter, they were delicious.
Happy St.</description>

      <description>Is this the most chill song in the world?
 In fact, listening to that one song ‚Äî ‚ÄúWeightless‚Äù ‚Äî resulted in a striking 65 percent reduction in participants‚Äô overall anxiety, and a 35 percent reduction in their usual physiological resting rates.
 I have a lot of tracks I listen to alter or set my mood, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen the phenomenon quantified so neatly. I&amp;rsquo;d like to see the measurable improvements in focus, attention, or creativity that music is capable of producing.</description>

      <description>Crows, in fact, might be like us not so much because they are clever (and so are we) but rather because they sometimes engage their cleverness simply for fun ‚Äì and so do we.
 What&amp;rsquo;s it like to be a crow? What do they make of us? Are animals capable of moral behavior? Having been a pet owner for many years I think this is true. I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve observed it.</description>

Welcome to this retroactively inserted yearly retrospective. The date I am writing this is actually December 30, 2020. If you&amp;rsquo;ve found this page, that means you&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon some content that, while genuinely old, was not originally posted on this date. Greetings from the future! Or something. I suppose I could make some joke right now warning you to &amp;ldquo;turn back&amp;rdquo; from the dread year 2020, but that whole bit seems tired and depressing.</description>

      <description>For all you folks out there enjoying the savings and discounts, and perhaps needing a little mood music to go along with.
  You might recognize that one. It&amp;rsquo;s sort of famous. Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the entire playlist, which I don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be able to embed on my page. Maybe that doesn&amp;rsquo;t even make sense. The 1950s gave birth to shopping music, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure its bright and chipper tone has ever been topped.</description>

      <description>An investigation into the disappearance of Kristal Reisinger from Crestone, Colorado.
Go to the main site, or listen on Apple Podcasts.
I was unimpressed by season one, which made host Payne Lindsey podcast-famous for cracking the notoriously cold case. This one is better. And it&amp;rsquo;s set in Colorado, which has some appeal to me. You can always tell people from there. They&amp;rsquo;re windblown, so to speak.
Check it out, if you like a mystery.</description>

      <description>He&amp;rsquo;s not a fan of the new Joker, though he greatly admires Nolan&amp;rsquo;s version.
 The truth is in your mask. The truth is in what you are doing.
 Interesting take.
 Paradoxically, a mask means I can be who I really am.
 His point, based in some psychological theory, is that our plain faces are the real masks; that in our normal lives we artificially conform ourselves because of social convention, expectations, etc; but that &amp;ldquo;our mask&amp;rdquo; allows us to break out of those restrictions, inviting the true self ‚Äì¬†the inner or even unconscious self ‚Äì to emerge.</description>

It was crowded, and we had to park a fair distance away, but we had a good time and were able to do what we went there to do. This is gonna be on our must-do list next year, but I think I&amp;rsquo;d like to get there earlier.</description>

      <description>One of my earliest memories is asking my mom to borrow an old Hallmark music box that played this song. It was important to me, though I couldn&amp;rsquo;t explain why. I&amp;rsquo;d listen to it over and over again, long past the point of annoyance to everyone. Sometimes at night, when I was scared, I&amp;rsquo;d listen to it to help me sleep. It has a sad, but sweet melody. At about 2:00 it has the proper timing, then very quickly starts to unwind.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Time does take its toll on the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you see when you look into a funhouse mirror? Another &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; staring out at you beneath the surface of the glass? &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; you are really just one of a whole army of such &amp;ldquo;you&amp;quot;s, none knowing for sure what side of the glass he falls on. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; you are now is just another picture frozen in time; something separate and distinct from all your past and future selves. Always dying, always being born; every thought and action carving its mark forever into the lines of your face and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine an app on your phone that would let you peer into that funhouse ‚Äî¬†would let you see those possibilities, those infinite &amp;ldquo;you&amp;quot;s that could have been. That &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, particularly those possibilities that involve you growing a beard, dying your hair, looking like a douchebag, or getting really old.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Who&amp;rsquo;s ready for fall?
You can count me in, though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure &amp;ldquo;ready&amp;rdquo; is the best word for it. Summer seemed to pass by so fast this year. Barely had time to really enjoy it, it seems, before it&amp;rsquo;s practically gone. They say this happens as you get older, but I suspect in my case it has more to do with a dearth of time spent outside this year, soaking up sun and heat.</description>

      <description>I love working from shopping malls. I was just telling Kassi the other day that they offer several advantages that suit me and my work style well. Doors open early. Easy access to restrooms. Most have at least some access to power; and free wifi, though I always tether. The ambient noise is generally at an appropriate level, though my current environment has somewhat more than the usual. More than anything I appreciate the large, wide open spaces and natural light that filters in through the ceiling glass.</description>

      <description>I always considered those things the grossest of the gross. But did get me thinking about alternative &amp;ldquo;comfortable&amp;rdquo; materials. A gel toilet seat? Cushion of air? Water? Yeah, like a water bed ‚Äî but instead it&amp;rsquo;s a toilet seat.
And if you don&amp;rsquo;t already follow the bro-science blog of Dollar Shave Club, you should. Way better than The Onion these days.</description>

      <description>Arrived in beautiful Telluride, Colorado, and yes, this is my first update since day #2 of vacation. So much for my Travel Log. Between lack of cell signal and surrendering my phone to the kid, and straight up being too busy and/or exhausted, I haven‚Äôt had much opportunity for posting.
We‚Äôve been busy!
Back to the Grand Canyon this year, and this time we got to spend a night in the park, with a chance to do some dawn/dusk shots of the canyon itself.</description>

      <description>Finally made it to Red Rock State Park, and made a couple of new discoveries along the way. Our route took us through what turned out be the incredibly beautiful Coconino National Forest, a place we have vowed to return. If Tolkien‚Äôs Elves were a real thing, they might just choose to live in a place like that. Verdant green forests around the bases of giant granite mountains, interspersed all along the way with little villages and expensive looking cabin retreats, with lights hanging from the trees across bridges that span crystal clear mountain streams.</description>

      <description>On the road from Albuquerque to Flagstaff, near which we turn south to Red Rock State Park in Arizona. The kids are keen to get in a hike today, the first ‚Äúreal‚Äù day of our vacation, as far as I‚Äôm concerned. It‚Äôs been fun watching the younger two get excited over taking pictures from the car with the little Instax Mini. That was Kassi‚Äôs great idea. We bought Anthony around 150 exposures and his eyes got wide when I told him I wanted him to use every single one by the end of the trip.</description>

      <description>Picture of me in the Llano Estacado, Texas‚Äôs ‚Äúwine country‚Äù. On the road for quite a while and still not out of the state. Holding up well. Fear the little one may be coming down with a cold. Hope he‚Äôs better after some rest.
Changed restaurant plans and will revisit our old favorite in Albuquerque for the third year in a row.
The food there has always been great, though the service is consistently slow.</description>

      <description>We‚Äôre well in to the big family road trip of 2019, and the obligatory Texas pit stop at Bucc-ees has been checked off the list. Would have sent you guys a pic from the storied Bucc-ees bathrooms, but I was too excited about these new hot n‚Äô spicy Beaver Nuggets! You can hear all about my first experience with those glorified Corn Pops in this review I did last year with my good buddy Brian.</description>

      <description>The second installment in my ongoing series of ambient environmental sound recordings. These are the sounds of me packing up my recorder and walking to the food court, where I order a bowl from Chipotle. I take my bowl outside to the patio to enjoy the fresh air and sunshine, after which I take a little walk around the mall to pick up some interesting sounds. And for the second time in a row I ran across a guy playing a piano.</description>

      <description>The name of this sculpture is Entwine, I think a reference to The Lord of the Rings. It‚Äôs supposed to be a tree, or plant, to symbolize Wylie‚Äôs connection to its roots. I always thought of it as a campfire, and I think that imagery fits much better for a library.</description>

She&amp;rsquo;s been killing it lately, posting about all the family stuff I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be getting to over on this site, but have been too lame to do. I swear she can fire off 3 or 4 posts by the time I&amp;rsquo;m done editing the same number of photos. Practice, I guess?</description>

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs no denying we live in troubled times in this country. Shared celebrations are a respite from the hate that seems set to smother our culture. They also serve as milestones, reminding us of the passage of time and providing a useful historical perspective on our own lives and the times we share with each other. For our part, we plan to celebrate like we haven‚Äôt in a while, venturing down to the mall later for the big party, then fireworks later tonight. Before that I‚Äôll be grilling pizzas in the backyard, and I hope to get a lot of today on camera.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Well, well. And I thought they&amp;rsquo;d retired. I suppose there are still a few living acts I&amp;rsquo;d pay to see after all. üê¶üêù No idea whether we&amp;rsquo;ll make it out to this one, but might bee nice.
Read all about my love for their Hall and Oates cover album. And give those songs a deep listen.

      <description>I decided to do something today I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to do for quite a while. I&amp;rsquo;m bringing back what they used to call in the early days of podcasting &amp;ldquo;soundseeing tours&amp;rdquo;, wherein people just recorded the ambient sounds of interesting places they visited or things they were doing. Not much time to do a writeup on this, as I&amp;rsquo;m about to board my flight, but here you can join me on my customary walk from Tom Bradley International terminal across the length and breadth of the airport.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t claim that I was one who helped to postpone the extinction. Somebody told me once as a kid that it contained pig&amp;rsquo;s brains, so I never ate it. It pretty much looked like jello&amp;rsquo;d meat, too, which didn&amp;rsquo;t add to the appeal. I&amp;rsquo;d try it today, though, if I still lived there, and probably would like it. Vinegar and pork is not a bad combo.</description>

Ants are my favorite insect. That they have actually been observed to plant coffee seeds, live in and among the plants they grow, and actually harvest the beans floors me with wonder for these remarkable creatures that are so different from us, yet so much resemble us in our social behaviors. This is real agriculture; and we already know they practice ranching and husbandry behaviors, with aphids for example ‚Äî &amp;ldquo;milking&amp;rdquo; them of the dew produced by their bodies.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around the beginning of May (and again in the fall) the city of Richardson, Texas invites artists from across the country to gather in Cottonwood Park for a big market day celebration of beauty and imagination. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cottonwoodartfestival.com&#34;&gt;The Cottonwood Art Festival&lt;/a&gt; features some brilliant and rigorously curated talent, and is described by the artists themselves as one of the best art shows in the country. This year we decided to pay a visit as a family. And although the younger two would crap out early from the mild heat and post-rainy day humidity, we did manage to hang around just long enough for me to discover my new favorite artist, Alla Tsank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on her later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In other news, I saw Detective Pikachu with the family a few days ago, and I think we all left impressed. Some strong acting and genuinely funny moments. Pikachu singing the Pok√©mon cartoon theme song was a highlight for me. But does Ryan Reynolds have to be in literally every movie now? That being said, he did a wonderful job. A really enjoyable and charming movie. Go see it. With your kids, of course.</description>

Everyone had gotten a new house, it seems, and the neighborhood itself had been newly laid out, and its boundaries expanded. Our house had been moved to the backside of the neighborhood by the creek, and the wooded area around the creek had been developed, so that our house, instead of looking out onto a wooded ravine as it would currently, was now at a &amp;ldquo;T&amp;rdquo; intersection in the middle of the larger neighborhood.</description>

&lt;p&gt;It was a rainy, Seattle-y Saturday morning in Dallas when I decided to take the kids out for a Daddy-Daughter-Baby Day run to Hypnotic Donuts, one of those fancy donut places that seem to be popping up around town these days like vape shops were five about years ago. They&amp;rsquo;d been asking me to take them on a Pok√©mon hunt, and I decided I&amp;rsquo;d treat them to breakfast as a bonus and incentive for getting up extra early.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>You would think that in this &amp;ldquo;woke&amp;rdquo; era the comedies of Norman Lear would be better appreciated, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think his many efforts to reboot his old series are going anywhere. Not because of any politically touchy subject matter, but because he saw the humanity in all of his characters, including those like Archie Bunker who he used to illustrate everything he saw as wrong with modern American attitudes, but whom he based on his own beloved father.</description>

Friends old and new. I am thankful for all of them. I am thankful for the things I have, inside and out. I am thankful for the places God has brought me to in the past year.
I met a man on the street named Emery Lambus who asked me for a couple of bucks to buy lunch.</description>

      <description>A cappuccino is a wonderful way to start the morning. Though this morning I can say I‚Äôve had better. There was a guy here who had one of those ironic mustaches. He could make good coffee. I wonder where he went. And if he still has that mustache. And if he left, maybe, to startup some better place that specializes in morning cappuccinos? And where that place might be, and if they have WiFi?</description>

&lt;p&gt;The weather was warmer today. I could feel spring in my bones. I get that way around this time of year. Maybe I was feeling a little homesick. Whatever the case, I&amp;rsquo;ve been craving Mexican food. I noticed this little while walking around during my lunch break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was standing outside the door reading the posted menuboard, an older lady passing by said to me &amp;ldquo;Go in. You&amp;rsquo;ll like it. It&amp;rsquo;s really good.&amp;rdquo; I took that as a sign.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I took a detour that night after my trip to the antique store. I passed along back streets, out of the way plazas, anywhere that looked like it might afford me new scenery. I stumbled across El Portal behind the headquarters of the Planetary Society, its aromas drawing my attention before I&amp;rsquo;d even rounded the corner to lay site on the place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The interesting things you run across when you decide to walk the mile and a half back to the hotel instead of Uber-ing. This is an old Methodist Church in the Playhouse District of Pasadena. Almost looks like an entrance to another world. A secret garden. A little foreboding perhaps.
There was a lot about this area I‚Äôd like to explore. I‚Äôll be back again.</description>

      <title>Brown Noise Tracks for Intense Focus</title>
      <link>http://tobyblog.com/posts/20190308-brown-noise/</link>

      <guid>http://tobyblog.com/posts/20190308-brown-noise/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve had the need to maintain a greater focus in my work and study. I find brown noise to be good way of filtering out distractions, to allow the mind to concentrate on a task. Brown noise tends to sit at a lower frequency than white noise, so the sound is deeper and more meditative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tracks that I like. Use headphones to get the most out of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHM-ympOZo0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very low, like a muffled waterfall from a distance. Very good track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today is Ash Wednesday, the Catholic holy day that begins the penitential season of Lent. This year I will not be celebrating as a Catholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year on September 1st Kassi and I, after a long season of spiritual apathy and suffering, took our first steps into the Russian Orthodox Church. There were private reasons, of course. Personal reasons that are always at the core of any conversion; but also open reasons. We did not take the step lightly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had this song stuck in my head for a couple of days, and maybe if I post it I can get rid of it. It&amp;rsquo;s from The Jerk, and features Bernadette Peters, my first screen crush when I was just a little kid. That bit at the end where she pulls out the coronet still cracks me up. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s a touching scene, don&amp;rsquo;t you think? A little reminder that life can be sweet sometimes.</description>

      <description>Infexxion is an iPhone game based on the old arcade game Attax. My cousin Carl introduced me to it. There was a cabinet in the lobby of a (surely long-since demolished?) movie theater in what is now a rough part of Lafayette, Louisiana. I forget what we were seeing that night. He played ‚Äî I didn&amp;rsquo;t, as I recall. It had a weird, edgy kind of quality to it, like an Exidy game.</description>

&lt;p&gt;My love, she weeps at many things,&lt;br&gt;
I would not for the world stop up her tears;&lt;br&gt;
She came in many years of drought&lt;br&gt;
And taught me just how right was private rain&lt;br&gt;
To touch the dust with smallest storm &lt;br&gt;
With emerald droppings from her eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I discovered the The Bird and Bee this past December when I heard their rendition of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/20181221-my-favorite-christmas-songs/&#34;&gt;The Twelve Days of Christmas&lt;/a&gt; at a bar in Honolulu. That led me to this album, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been burning it up lately on drives and at work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A pop take on jazz noir from his best album. Many years ago Kass and I listened to this cassette so much we broke the tape.
I hope you all are having a mellow moment, whenever it is for you. I know I am.
I find jazz noir goes best with whiskey.

      <title>A Few of My Favorite Christmas Songs</title>
      <link>http://tobyblog.com/posts/20181221-my-favorite-christmas-songs/</link>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hands down my favorite Christmas song of 2018. I passed up this album in favor of Jackie Gleason&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Tis The Season&lt;/em&gt;, a purchase I do not regret, but this song is definitely worth the price of the vinyl. I love it when Frank sings melancholy, and this one has that quality in spades. Nostalgia, regret, and loneliness are all wrapped up in that golden bow of his amazing voice, a voice that forces your ears to attention when you hear it, never aging, never dulling, calling your life before your eyes, and all but materializing that glass of whiskey or scotch in your left hand, as your right hand reaches to pull the brim of your fedora down a little more to cover the tears in your eyes. Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>October, you have been one long, soggy mess. C&amp;rsquo;est la vie, I suppose. To commemorate what I anticipate to be tonight&amp;rsquo;s non-event, I have chosen this song to be the official &amp;ldquo;hold&amp;rdquo; music of Halloween 2018, to be played in a continuous loop until one metaphorically throws up one&amp;rsquo;s hands in disgust, and finally gives up the game. To pick it up again next year? Perhaps. But never quite in the same way.</description>

      <description>Even if Francis is a liberal, it is far from clear to us that the proper response is liberalism. This, then, is the crux of the problem. Barring the Head of the Church returning, there will be other popes. Perhaps some will be, in the words of the great Louisiana philosopher and theologian I.J. Reilly, good authoritarian popes. Perhaps some will be liberals. However, the anti-liberal position works as well with a good authoritarian pope as it does with a liberal pope.</description>

      <description>I think I just found my Halloween costume for this year.
How did I ever miss this? It debuted just last year for the 40th anniversary celebration of Frank Zappa&amp;rsquo;s legendary Halloween concert series at The Palladium in New York. Zappa did Halloween concerts throughout the entirety of his career, but the one in 1977 is generally considered to be the apogee of that grand tradition.
To commemorate that series of shows (which ran from October 28-31), the family released a massive box set that includes all six concerts on a USB stick, in 24-bit WAV audio for a flawless sound experience, PLUS a jaw-dropping adult size Frank Zappa costume in vintage 70s plastic style.</description>

The anticipation, that period of time I like to call &amp;ldquo;the run-up to the countdown&amp;rdquo;, starts to build throughout August, so that by the time this event rolls around Kassi and the kids and I are practically bursting with Halloween excitement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Today I mowed the back yard for the first time this spring. I am behind. The weather and other duties had kept me off task. The grass was high, and each square foot I tread into submission was like a territory reclaimed for civilization.
I asked myself when people started doing this whole thing. Exactly how old is the time honored American activity of mowing the lawn? And why is this mundane chore, as therapeutic and contemplative as it is, not shown more love by those in the Big Nostalgia set, so connected as it is to real childhood and adolescent memory?</description>

      <description>Being sick on a trip is the worst. I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been sleeping every spare moment I get. Managed to catch a pretty decent cheese ball of a movie, though. It was old school campy fun in the best way. Nicely captured the feel of old 80s schlock-horror movies like The Gate and Return of the Living Dead.</description>

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in a smell? The power to evoke. Memories. People. Places. And special times in our lives. Seasons long forgotten. All brought back in an instant the second a particular aroma hits our nostrils. It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder that scented candles, long thought domain of grandmas and boring little gift shops, have become respected among the nostalgia set in recent years. I read once that people don&amp;rsquo;t remember scents; that you remember the things associated with it or the strong feelings the scent creates, but the brain does not store memory of the scent itself. And now I find myself trying to remember what the woods smell like in autumn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year again folks, that magical time between Christmas and New Year where thoughtful commentators like myself come out with their end of year retrospectives; and continuing a tradition I established a couple of years back on this site, I intend to give you my take on the best of my buddy Brian Hammons&#39; output over on the internet&amp;rsquo;s most beloved nostalgia blog, ReviewTheWorld.com.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.holidaywarehouse.com/&#34;&gt;Holiday Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; is a largish, and rather outstanding, independent holiday decor shop located in Plano, Texas. Like its well known cousin The &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/20150826-the-decorators-warehouse/&#34;&gt;Decorator&amp;rsquo;s Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in Arlington, the concentration is mainly on Christmas, but not as exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Remember Taco Naan, the Mexican-Indian hybrid restaurant &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/20140226-taco-naan-review/&#34;&gt;I wrote about&lt;/a&gt; a long time back? I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the very same one my buddy &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/03/texas-taco-challenge-taco-naan-vs-fuel.html&#34;&gt;Brian featured&lt;/a&gt; on his second trip to the Big D, where he stacked up its offerings against the nationally renowned taco dive Fuel City. Well, they&amp;rsquo;re still around and busier and better than ever! The place is expanding like mad, doubling its interior floor space and hopefully renovating those dismal restrooms. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know because I&amp;rsquo;ve never had the courage to try them again. But you don&amp;rsquo;t go to Taco Naan to use the bathroom, man, so no worries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Beer is great year-round, but summer brings its own varieties. I noticed recently that hard ciders are becoming more popular. I had a chance to sample a new one from Ace, makers of an outstanding pumpkin cider that I am very much looking forward to having again this fall. Their pear cider, available in all seasons, merits a future review. But this one I had not seen before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Today marks the 30th anniversary of two very special, very &amp;ldquo;eighties&amp;rdquo; movies that I happen to love. The (legitimate) Transformers The Movie, and Space Camp, which I watched for the first time only a year or so ago with the kids.
I honestly can&amp;rsquo;t remember when I first saw the Transformers movie, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the theaters. I was the only one of my group of friends that caught it months, if not years later, after it came out on VHS.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What the pack?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin Carl, &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/20160415-sfanthor-house-of-wax/&#34;&gt;as previously featured on Tobyblog&lt;/a&gt;, sent this to me for my birthday. Get a load. It&amp;rsquo;s almost like he knows me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Here in North Texas the sun is shining. The weather is warming up. The world outside is getting brighter. The Texas wildflowers are already in bloom, thanks to a mild and soggy winter. In the woods, things are moving. The itchy season is upon us, and the window of opportunity for a lot of local geocaches is closing, as the casual players tend to steer clear of anything that might put them in the way of tall grass, poison ivy, or the dreaded tick.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/20150410-a-visit-to-collectors-crypt/&#34;&gt;Collector&amp;rsquo;s Crypt?&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about that place around this time last year. It&amp;rsquo;s closed now. I had a dream about it the other night, or rather its next incarnation, which was as a hybrid Christmas/Halloween store. I know the owners have an interest in Christmas things, so that detail is not too surprising. But in my dream, there was also a functional toilet over by the register. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what that was supposed to mean.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;2015 was the year I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/20150921-the-dark-hour-best-haunt-ever/&#34;&gt;Dark Hour Haunted House&lt;/a&gt;, and you probably realize by now what a fan I am. We are very fortunate to live in an area with access to a year round haunt. To be able to be successful at that requires a level of quality and showmanship, frankly, above your average haunt. Not to detract from anyone else in the business (no one can do it all!), but I think it does hold true. In getting to know these guys and the haunt itself a little better over these past few months, it is becoming clear how much of an inspiration they are to other folks in the industry. And I&amp;rsquo;ve still not yet discovered all they have to offer!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;September 29th is the feast of St. Michael the Archangel, or Michaelmas as it is known in European countries. St. Michael cast the devil out of heaven, and is the commander of the armies of God. He is traditionally shown fighting a dragon, or with his foot on the back of the devil. He is the patron of soldiers and police officers, but also of the ill and suffering. He has appeared to people at various times curing diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I discovered The Dark Hour in March, at St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day of all times, and I fell in love. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the skills to work there, but I think if I could just secretly sneak in and live there, I would. I&amp;rsquo;d be like that weird guy from the movies who lives between the walls somehow, and you hear him rummaging around in the fridge at night. Just hope I don&amp;rsquo;t get caught! Cause you know, awkward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are officially in the &amp;ldquo;-BER months&amp;rdquo; now, a time of year that for my generation is indelibly stamped by the melancholy Peanuts cartoon soundtracks of Vince Guiraldi and his trio. Though the nostalgic quality of these tracks reaches fever pitch around Christmastime, we begin our seasonal contemplation with this wistful little tune, quickly supplanted in the Guiraldi lineup, but never quite forgotten. It remains one of my favorites, but I&amp;rsquo;ll only listen to it from the start of September through Halloween.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you looking for something spooky to watch as we wind our way down to Halloween, but find yourself bored by the usual fare of cheesy monster movies or gross slasher flicks? Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re in the mood for something a little more thoughtful; a little more substantial, perhaps? Let me show you something interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Decorator&amp;rsquo;s Warehouse, located in Arlington, Texas, bills itself as Texas&amp;rsquo;s largest Christmas store. And it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; very large. But what really impresses you upon entering the place is just how jam-packed it is with holiday and seasonal baubles, as if despite its football-field size floor space they still did not have quite enough room to fit everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This year I attended Texas Frightmare Weekend for the first time. By now it seems like forever ago. But lucky you ‚Äî I saved all the pictures! So here they are without much verbal adornment, or it&amp;rsquo;d probably take me another month and a half to get this up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collector&amp;rsquo;s Crypt is a boutique shop in Dallas specializing in horror and sci-fi collectibles, memorabilia, paraphernalia, and‚Ä¶ well, you just gotta see it, folks. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing place. I discovered them only recently after attending the St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Slay Weekend event at &lt;a href=&#34;http://darkhourhauntedhouse.com/&#34;&gt;Dark Hour Haunted House&lt;/a&gt; in Plano. They were a sponsor of that particular show, so Dark Hour graciously gave them some floor space to sell a few wares after the show and otherwise promote the store. Now it&amp;rsquo;s not like Dallas has a whole lot of shops like this; in fact, I cannot think of &lt;em&gt;one other&lt;/em&gt;. So it piqued my interest. I noticed that they are located only a short distance across the river from where I currently work, so I decided to pop in on my next available lunch hour.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We have reached &amp;ldquo;Peak Blogger&amp;rdquo; in this society, folks. If the existence of Tobyblog was not proof of that already, take a look at the above picture. It was a cold, blustery Saturday afternoon and I was visiting nearby Arlington. It was around lunchtime and I had some time to kill, so I decided to walk over to the nearby strip mall and scope out the restaurants. There were a surprising number of cuisines on offer for such a small area, but this place caught my eye. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;Brian Hammons&lt;/a&gt; had mentioned to me recently how his buddy Nick Van Bever is a fan of chicken strips and fries. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d do some recon for Nick, in case he ever makes his way down to Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Those of you paying &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/20140202-the-beginning/&#34;&gt;close attention&lt;/a&gt; will remember that Tobyblog owes its existence to my good buddy Brian Hammons of the nostalgia blog &lt;a href=&#34;http://reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;reviewtheworld.com&lt;/a&gt;. His site is a surprisingly deep personal catalog that is as much a call to action and personal philosophical movement as anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;lsquo;Red Death&amp;rsquo; had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal ‚Äî the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already a great place to find exotic candies, foreign soda pop, and specialty food items at any time of the year (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/09/3-green-sodas.html&#34;&gt;Brian Hammons&lt;/a&gt;, you know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about), World Market really comes alive for Halloween. If you&amp;rsquo;ve got one in your area, get down there right now and check their selection. The stuff they carry is definitely outside of the Target/Big Lots/Dollar Store Halloween mold, but that&amp;rsquo;s not to say it&amp;rsquo;s super expensive. This year the emphasis is (appropriately) on Halloween&amp;rsquo;s Mexican cousin, El Dia de los Muertos ‚Äî The Day of the Dead ‚Äî because of a merchandising tie-in with the upcoming movie &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bookoflifemovie.com/&#34;&gt;The Book of Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I took the kids to the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;http://retropalooza.net/&#34;&gt;Retropalooza&lt;/a&gt; convention in Arlington, Texas, and boy did we have a blast! There were loads and loads of dealer tables with some very cool nostalgia items on display, classic and rare games galore, cosplayers, and even a few YouTube celebrities. Take a look at some of the fun things we discovered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Greetings, friends! It&amp;rsquo;s been a few days since my last update, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been idle. Have you noticed how early the stores are stocking for Halloween this year? I blogged about my first sighting at &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/20140726-halloween-has-arrived-at-at-home/&#34;&gt;At Home (formerly Garden Ridge)&lt;/a&gt; which was on July 1st, a full one month earlier than last year. (And if you&amp;rsquo;re interested, that was at a chain called Home Goods, where the theme of ravens &amp;amp; blackbirds predominated.) Naturally, I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on the usual merchants ever since, and they have not disappointed!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about being a dad to small kids is that you always have a built-in excuse to be in the toy aisle. And if you have your kids with you then nobody looks twice at you as you gawk at all the amazing stuff on the store shelves these days. We are living in a golden age for toys and board games. Sure, there were a lot of really cool toys that I miss from the seventies and eighties that I wish my kids had a chance to experience, but today&amp;rsquo;s market offers a certain quality and vast variety of toys and other amusements that the old days could never touch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Garden Ridge recently declared bankruptcy, and are now being reincorporated as At Home. But true to form, the seasons still come early there and stay late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dear wife noticed yesterday that one of the nearby stores had been refurbished, so we decided to drop in and check it out. I of course had high hopes for what to expect, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a little independent retro gaming store in Plano that is the closest thing to a real arcade that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced with the kids. There are still a lot of places you could call &amp;ldquo;arcades&amp;rdquo;, mostly attached to chain family restaurants like Chuck-E-Cheese or entertainment complexes like Fun Zone or Amazing Jakes. But the key differentiator for me is that the machines take real quarters, preferably only one per play. I always hated changing tokens, and to me the idea of plopping tokens into a machine screws with the mythology somehow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This keeps happening to me over and over and over again lately. I have to make use of the public facilities (seldom a delightful experience anyway), I go to the sink, wash my hands, look up, and see this mess ‚Äî&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Orleans is, of course, a city known for its food, home to some of the best chefs in the country. I was in town recently, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d check out some of the local establishments and give you guys a virtual sight-tasting tour. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the hotel vending machine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Love this song. Local musician Bruce Wilder was recently performing it solo at Firewheel Coffee, my office away from the office. Makes me want to sneak up behind him with a giant saxophone and start blaring away at the appropriate moments.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like geocaching for lots of reasons. I like to be outside. I like discovering new places. I like walking and connecting with nature. But occasionally I learn something as well. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s just local historical trivia, or maybe a geography lesson. But sometimes the lesson is more personal, and as in this case, tragic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning started out with a trip to the Trinity Trails in Wylie, Texas for some hiking and caching. We chose to start at the easternmost trailhead, which was also the closest to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a little marina at the trailhead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m celebrating a major personal milestone today, and I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a more fitting way to commemorate it on this site than by encouraging you all to watch one of my favorite episodes of The Ray Bradbury Theater from 1989, The Wonderful Death of Dudley Stone. This episode is indeed all about decisions, priorities, and focusing on what&amp;rsquo;s important in life.

&lt;p&gt;I have no particular fear of clowns. I am not one of those people. But this thing gives me the creeps. Downright turns my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Top 10 Review the World Episodes of 2013</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since Brian and Review the World were my main inspirations in starting my own blog, I figured it would be fitting to begin by introducing some of my favorite episodes from the past year. According to Brian, 2013 was one of the busiest years he&amp;rsquo;s ever had on the site, and it shows. He had a ton of great content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-the-brian-and-tim-show-episode-25-halloween-extra---ufo-and-ghost-discussionhttpwwwreviewtheworldcom201310b-show-25-ufo-ghost-discussionhtmlm0&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2013/10/b-show-25-ufo-ghost-discussion.html?m=0&#34;&gt;#10: The Brian and Tim Show Episode #25: Halloween Extra - UFO and Ghost Discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sort of an extended special segment of the 2013 Halloween episode, Brian and Tim decide to talk about their own experiences with the paranormal. Basically this was how my cousins and I spent many a late night when I was younger, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure by the end of this you&amp;rsquo;ll be talking to your screen wanting to add your two cents. Who knows? Maybe some of mine will get featured on this blog one day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Beginning.</title>

      <description>My name is Toby.
In the spring of 2013 I discovered Brian Hammons&#39; blog Review the World, and something inside clicked. Here was a guy ‚Äî just slightly my junior ‚Äî getting out and enjoying life with his friends, exploring his local environment, and generally on fire with all the possibilities that an ordinary life offers to those who know how to look for them. I had spent the bulk of 2012 doing all of those things with my two older kids while my wife was, for the most part (and regrettably), stuck at home working and/or gestating.</description>
