<p><em><strong>Who&rsquo;s ready for fall?</strong></em></p>
<p>You can count me in, though I&rsquo;m not sure &ldquo;ready&rdquo; is the best word for it. Summer seemed to pass by so fast this year. Barely had time to really <em>enjoy</em> it, it seems, before it&rsquo;s practically gone. They say this happens as you get older, but I suspect in my case it has more to do with a dearth of time spent outside this year, soaking up sun and heat. That kind of thing has a way of slowing down clock and calendar. Try it and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean.</p>
<p>Nevertheless we <em>did</em> get out to see some fairly amazing things in the past few weeks, which I&rsquo;m very keen to show you. I took an awful lot of pics during our three days at the Grand Canyon, which was our next stop after <a href="https://tobyblog.com/photos/20190817-red-rock-state-park/">Red Rock</a>, and I&rsquo;m quite satisified with them overall. We booked both the sunset and sunrise bus tours, and although that was a mixed bag for me due to an amateurish camera setting screwup, I still managed to get some impressive photos of the canyon, far better than last year&rsquo;s set.</p>
<p>What made me happiest, though, was the opportunity to photograph some of the canyon ravens and crows up close this time, thanks to my P1000 and its powerful zoom lens. I edited this one especially to hang up on our wall during the Halloween season.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping for a better one this year.</p>
