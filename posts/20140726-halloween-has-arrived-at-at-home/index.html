<p>Garden Ridge recently declared bankruptcy, and are now being reincorporated as At Home. But true to form, the seasons still come early there and stay late.</p>
<p>My dear wife noticed yesterday that one of the nearby stores had been refurbished, so we decided to drop in and check it out. I of course had high hopes for what to expect, and I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed.</p>
<p>Indeed, Halloween and fall are in full swing there.</p>
<p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-J5801L0a-UI/U9SBYEQxgiI/AAAAAAAAAlI/ppYPbZvhAjQ/s2048/IMG_1423.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I was hoping that maybe they&rsquo;d have a display shelf set up with some early goodies, but it looked like they already had most of their yard and interior decorations out on the shelves.</p>
<p>TheVCubeSolver and I just looked at each other in amazement. I had to remind myself that outside it was 103 degrees and felt more like 110, and still July. We hadn&rsquo;t even hit the dog days yet, and hatch chili season and the overall magic of late summer was still a few weeks away.<br /><br />Inside that store it was a cold first of October.</p>
<p>Making her appearance this year is the Witch of the West, and I have to say she makes a pretty good lawn ornament.</p>

<p>The quality of the pieces was generally pretty amazing, and there were some real bargains to be found.</p>

<p>Mixed in among the Halloween merch at the front of the store were a few token pieces offering a nod to that oft-neglected and under-appreciated other fall holiday, Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d9ioE1vF-YQ/U9SEQggCkxI/AAAAAAAAAmM/Hr1o9wbGt2E/s2048/IMG_1434.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>They had a really large selection of stock which consisted of three large display shelves at the store entrance, with at least 7-10 rows of shelves that stretched off to the right.</p>

<p>TheVCubeSolver dressed up as Napoleon a couple of years ago. Hey look, they misspelled it!</p>

<p>Love the distorted facial features my pano shot gave TheVCubeSolver in this one.</p>

<p>These guys were awesome and one of the most lifelike (death-like?) pieces on the shelves.</p>

<p>ThePonyOwner says the theme this year is ghosts &amp; spiders. We&rsquo;ll see if this guy makes an appearance.</p>
