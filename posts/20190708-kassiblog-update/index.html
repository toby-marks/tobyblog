        <p>If you haven&rsquo;t been following Kassi over on her personal blog, by all means go there and check it out. She&rsquo;s been killing it lately, posting about all the family stuff I&rsquo;m supposed to be getting to over on this site, but have been too lame to do. I swear she can fire off 3 or 4 posts by the time I&rsquo;m done editing the same number of photos. Practice, I guess? Her latest one about the John Muir books she&rsquo;s been collecting has put me in a very vacation-y kind of mood. I thought it was funny that she called me out for still working on photos from two years ago, which is true. But I have learned (what I think is) a whole lot in the meantime, and my camera and software suite, and hopefully my editing sensibilities, have evolved a great deal in that time. It&rsquo;s been fun revisiting those not-so-old photos and reminiscing on the times we spent out on the road in some very rugged country. I&rsquo;d honestly forgotten just how pretty it was up in Colorado the summer of 2017. Anyway, enjoy the blog and hopefully get inspired yourself. John Muir was a great man, one of this nation&rsquo;s finest. And more to come here on all that as well.</p>
