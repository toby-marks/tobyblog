<meta property="og:description" content="She&rsquo;s right, the Little Elm Autumn Fest was a blast. We went Friday on Oktoberfest night and the polka band was amazing, as were the food trucks and local craft beer. It was crowded, and we had to park a fair distance away, but we had a good time and were able to do what we went there to do. This is gonna be on our must-do list next year, but I think I&rsquo;d like to get there earlier." />
