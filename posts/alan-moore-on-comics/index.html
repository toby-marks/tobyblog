<p>The culture is dumbing down, becoming more juvenile, and this is just one manifestation of that.</p>

<p>I like his interpretation of heroes as &ldquo;cowardice compensators&rdquo;. He seemed to be making a specific reference to conditions in the comic publishing business, but I wonder if it&rsquo;s true in a larger sense, for the people who create comics and for the broader culture. I&rsquo;d like to see more of that kind of psycho-social analysis.</p>
