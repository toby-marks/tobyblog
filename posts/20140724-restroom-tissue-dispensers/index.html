<p>Now what is wrong with this picture? Take a look at how this works.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JCOUiFmIvJk/U9Fw4TbxbOI/AAAAAAAAAkQ/NDn5bZH8FqQ/s640/blogger-image--1827737721.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to pull the sheets from the bottom, and the angular momentum of your pull dispenses the next sheet. But what if there&rsquo;s no sheet? Huh? What then?!</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zkDqWVsBa4I/U9Fw7G1hklI/AAAAAAAAAkY/CzPWP4RKGI8/s640/blogger-image-1156149362.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s clearly paper in there, but somebody ripped the damn thing off right at the source! And on models like these, there is no lever to force a tissue feed. You know how hard it is to coax that sheet out given the few millimeters of purchase visible in the above pic?</p>
<p>Nigh impossible.</p>
<p>But yet, somehow I&rsquo;ved managed it. Every. Single. Time.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OlpkWym9YsQ/U9FwzsNaeDI/AAAAAAAAAkI/lmJBKipsY0A/s640/blogger-image-1237055518.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Are people too anal to leave a sheet hanging from the dispenser? Because you really have to try hard to tear it off right at the top. I can tell you that this is how it&rsquo;s supposed to look when you leave the restroom, for the convenience the folks who come in after you.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about it.</p>
