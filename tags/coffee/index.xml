Ants are my favorite insect. That they have actually been observed to plant coffee seeds, live in and among the plants they grow, and actually harvest the beans floors me with wonder for these remarkable creatures that are so different from us, yet so much resemble us in our social behaviors. This is real agriculture; and we already know they practice ranching and husbandry behaviors, with aphids for example ‚Äî &amp;ldquo;milking&amp;rdquo; them of the dew produced by their bodies.</description>

      <description>A cappuccino is a wonderful way to start the morning. Though this morning I can say I‚Äôve had better. There was a guy here who had one of those ironic mustaches. He could make good coffee. I wonder where he went. And if he still has that mustache. And if he left, maybe, to startup some better place that specializes in morning cappuccinos? And where that place might be, and if they have WiFi?</description>
