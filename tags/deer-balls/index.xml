      <description>This is a tribute video to my brother. You can think of it as the pilot episode of a fictional reality show series. It includes some backyard wrestling, a special cooking segment also featured in the 2015 Thanksgiving Special, and a frog tossing competition using actual Louisiana bull frogs. It is wild, and like the man himself, not quite safe for work!</description>

      <description>After taking some time off to contemplate the overwhelming success of my Burger King poop tweet*, we now return to our regularly scheduled programming.&#xA;In truth October is always a busy month for us and I don&amp;rsquo;t have much spare time for blogging. This past Halloween was without a doubt the best yet, but I&amp;rsquo;ll save that retrospective for another day. For today we find ourselves at the end of November, as grand a month as any.</description>
