	  This year I attended Texas Frightmare Weekend for the first time. By now it seems like forever ago. But lucky you — I saved all the pictures! So here they are without much verbal adornment, or it&rsquo;d probably take me another month and a half to get this up.

I suggest you take your time with this post. It&rsquo;s a big one. Really savor the photographs. Left-click to enlarge them.

	  From a respectful write-up on Texas Frightmare Weekend by Dread Central:
Can we stop calling Texas Frightmare Weekend a “regional con” now? The first reader I met this year was Aaron from Australia, who had flown all the way here to experience TFW as his FIRST con.
I met that guy! Twice. Sat right next to him at the special 35mm screening of Phantasm at the Alamo Draft House in Richardson.

	  Dr. Channard from Hellraiser II, in all his gloryCollector's Crypt is a boutique shop in Dallas specializing in horror and sci-fi collectibles, memorabilia, paraphernalia, and… well, you just gotta see it, folks. It's an amazing place. I discovered them only recently after attending the St. Patrick's Slay Weekend event at Dark Hour Haunted House in Plano. They were a sponsor of that particular show, so Dark Hour graciously gave them some floor space to sell a few wares after the show and otherwise promote the store.

	  Would you like to win this original 8 x 10 photograph that hung in our house this past Halloween? It&rsquo;s a portrait inspired by my all-time favorite Halloween blog, The Skull and Pumpkin of Mike Cathcart&rsquo;s. The updates have been spotty over these past few years, but the back content is well worth discovering for yourself. If you do take a look, be sure to leave a comment in appreciation.

  <p>
	
	  Already a great place to find exotic candies, foreign soda pop, and specialty food items at any time of the year (Brian Hammons, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about), World Market really comes alive for Halloween. If you&rsquo;ve got one in your area, get down there right now and check their selection. The stuff they carry is definitely outside of the Target/Big Lots/Dollar Store Halloween mold, but that&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s super expensive.
