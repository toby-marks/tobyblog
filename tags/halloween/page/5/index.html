	  HALLOWEEN LOVERS EVERYWHERE, IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THE LEMAX SPOOKY TOWN COLLECTION AT MICHAELS, FIND ONE NEAR YOU AND GO THERE.&nbsp;NOW.

I am not kidding.
I discovered the world of Lemax Village collectibles only a year ago. They also make Christmas sets, but the Halloween village is sold exclusively at Michaels. Now I&rsquo;m not normally the kind of guy that goes gaga for stuff like this, but the artistry and imagination evident in these pieces is hard to deny.

	  Greetings, friends! It&rsquo;s been a few days since my last update, but I haven&rsquo;t been idle. Have you noticed how early the stores are stocking for Halloween this year? I blogged about my first sighting at At Home&nbsp;(formerly Garden Ridge)&nbsp;which was on July 1st, a full one month earlier than last year. (And if you&rsquo;re interested, that was at a chain called Home Goods, where the theme of ravens &amp; blackbirds predominated.

	  Yesterday Yankee Candle had a special one-day preview of their upcoming Halloween 2014 collection, and we dropped in to get a look. Thanks to @PerkyJewels #FF for the tip-off!


Tragically, most of the "Bonies" decorations were sold out by the time we got there. We were told by staff that most of the merchandise was gone within the first half-hour of the store opening, so that should show you the amazing pent-up demand for Halloween this year.

	  The great thing about being a dad to small kids is that you always have a built-in excuse to be in the toy aisle. And if you have your kids with you then nobody looks twice at you as you gawk at all the amazing stuff on the store shelves these days. We are living in a golden age for toys and board games. Sure, there were a lot of really cool toys that I miss from the seventies and eighties that I wish my kids had a chance to experience, but today's market offers a certain quality and vast variety of toys and other amusements that the old days could never touch.
