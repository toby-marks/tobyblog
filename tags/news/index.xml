&lt;p&gt;I got to tag along recently to an impromptu press conference called at Cook Children&amp;rsquo;s Medical Center in Ft. Worth by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.texasrighttolife.com&#34;&gt;Texas Right to Life&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.texasrighttolife.com/urgent-cook-childrens-to-pull-plug-on-9-month-baby/&#34;&gt;read about the unfortunate circumstances here&lt;/a&gt;. We were expecting Kassi to speak to the legal issues involved, but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t questioned at that time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>He&amp;rsquo;s not a fan of the new Joker, though he greatly admires Nolan&amp;rsquo;s version.
The truth is in your mask. The truth is in what you are doing.
Interesting take.
Paradoxically, a mask means I can be who I really am.
His point, based in some psychological theory, is that our plain faces are the real masks; that in our normal lives we artificially conform ourselves because of social convention, expectations, etc; but that &amp;ldquo;our mask&amp;rdquo; allows us to break out of those restrictions, inviting the true self ‚Äì¬†the inner or even unconscious self ‚Äì to emerge.</description>

      <description>She went on: ‚ÄúI never believed the whole ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy single‚Äô spiel. I was like, ‚ÄòThis is totally spiel.‚Äô It took me a long time, but I‚Äôm very happy [being single]. I call it being self-partnered.‚Äù
The only story here is how much Emma Watson uses the Hollywood word spiel.</description>

      <title>A History of the Puffy Toilet Seat</title>

      <description>I always considered those things the grossest of the gross. But did get me thinking about alternative &amp;ldquo;comfortable&amp;rdquo; materials. A gel toilet seat? Cushion of air? Water? Yeah, like a water bed ‚Äî but instead it&amp;rsquo;s a toilet seat.
And if you don&amp;rsquo;t already follow the bro-science blog of Dollar Shave Club, you should. Way better than The Onion these days.</description>

      <title>Hogs Head Cheese: A Disappearing Delicacy</title>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t claim that I was one who helped to postpone the extinction. Somebody told me once as a kid that it contained pig&amp;rsquo;s brains, so I never ate it. It pretty much looked like jello&amp;rsquo;d meat, too, which didn&amp;rsquo;t add to the appeal. I&amp;rsquo;d try it today, though, if I still lived there, and probably would like it. Vinegar and pork is not a bad combo.</description>

      <title>Do Ants Like Coffee?</title>

Ants are my favorite insect. That they have actually been observed to plant coffee seeds, live in and among the plants they grow, and actually harvest the beans floors me with wonder for these remarkable creatures that are so different from us, yet so much resemble us in our social behaviors. This is real agriculture; and we already know they practice ranching and husbandry behaviors, with aphids for example ‚Äî &amp;ldquo;milking&amp;rdquo; them of the dew produced by their bodies.</description>

      <description>Something that popped up in my Instagram feed. Win a trip for two to London? Maybe a good excuse for a little Harry/Hermione cosplay. Might have to borrow the kid‚Äôs graduation robe&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>The Resurrection of Archie Bunker</title>

      <description>You would think that in this &amp;ldquo;woke&amp;rdquo; era the comedies of Norman Lear would be better appreciated, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think his many efforts to reboot his old series are going anywhere. Not because of any politically touchy subject matter, but because he saw the humanity in all of his characters, including those like Archie Bunker who he used to illustrate everything he saw as wrong with modern American attitudes, but whom he based on his own beloved father.</description>
