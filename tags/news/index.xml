      <description>I always considered those things the grossest of the gross. But did get me thinking about alternative &amp;ldquo;comfortable&amp;rdquo; materials. A gel toilet seat? Cushion of air? Water? Yeah, like a water bed ‚Äî but instead it&amp;rsquo;s a toilet seat.

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t claim that I was one who helped to postpone the extinction. Somebody told me once as a kid that it contained pig&amp;rsquo;s brains, so I never ate it. It pretty much looked like jello&amp;rsquo;d meat, too, which didn&amp;rsquo;t add to the appeal. I&amp;rsquo;d try it today, though, if I still lived there, and probably would like it. Vinegar and pork is not a bad combo.</description>

      <title>Do Ants Like Coffee?</title>

Ants are my favorite insect. That they have actually been observed to plant coffee seeds, live in and among the plants they grow, and actually harvest the beans floors me with wonder for these remarkable creatures that are so different from us, yet so much resemble us in our social behaviors. This is real agriculture; and we already know they practice ranching and husbandry behaviors, with aphids for example ‚Äî &amp;ldquo;milking&amp;rdquo; them of the dew produced by their bodies.</description>

      <title>The Resurrection of Archie Bunker</title>

      <description>You would think that in this &amp;ldquo;woke&amp;rdquo; era the comedies of Norman Lear would be better appreciated, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think his many efforts to reboot his old series are going anywhere. Not because of any politically touchy subject matter, but because he saw the humanity in all of his characters, including those like Archie Bunker who he used to illustrate everything he saw as wrong with modern American attitudes, but whom he based on his own beloved father.</description>
