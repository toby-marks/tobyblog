	  <p>I can&rsquo;t claim that I was one who helped to postpone the extinction. Somebody told me once as a kid that it contained pig&rsquo;s brains, so I never ate it. It pretty much looked like jello&rsquo;d meat, too, which didn&rsquo;t add to the appeal. I&rsquo;d try it today, though, if I still lived there, and probably would like it. Vinegar and pork is not a bad combo.</p>

<p>Ants are my favorite insect. That they have actually been observed to plant coffee seeds, live in and among the plants they grow, and actually harvest the beans floors me with wonder for these remarkable creatures that are so different from us, yet so much resemble us in our social behaviors. This is real agriculture; and we already know they practice ranching and husbandry behaviors, with aphids for example ‚Äî &ldquo;milking&rdquo; them of the dew produced by their bodies. That <strong>coffee</strong> is what they go for makes me love them even more.</p>
<p>But the article also tells a remarkable story about a South American farmer trying to learn from nature, in a way that hurts him financially, but that he thinks is important for his country and for the future. We&rsquo;d never know these things were it not for people like that. And who knows what else there is yet to discover.</p>

	  <p>You would think that in this &ldquo;woke&rdquo; era the comedies of Norman Lear would be better appreciated, but I don&rsquo;t think his many efforts to reboot his old series are going anywhere. Not because of any politically touchy subject matter, but because he saw the humanity in all of his characters, including those like Archie Bunker who he used to illustrate everything he saw as wrong with modern American attitudes, but whom he based on his own beloved father. Modern folks aren&rsquo;t interested in any of that. They don&rsquo;t want subtleties, they certainly don&rsquo;t want to be challenged. They only want to condemn.</p>
<p>This one-night revival ought to be a fine tribute with some great casting. I think Woody Harrelson is a pretty perfect pick for Archie, and Marissa Tomei as Edith will be something to watch. Wanda Sykes would have made a natural Florence, though; I wouldn&rsquo;t have cast her as Weezy. I think Sherman Hemsley&rsquo;s George Jefferson is even more iconic than Archie Bunker, and it&rsquo;s going to be tough to do his portrayal justice.</p>
<p>As a Norman Lear fan I&rsquo;ll want to see this, and I&rsquo;ll certainly be wearing my &ldquo;Shut Up Honkey&rdquo; t-shirt.</p>
