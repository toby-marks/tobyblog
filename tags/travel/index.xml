      <description>I decided to do something today I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to do for quite a while. I&amp;rsquo;m bringing back what they used to call in the early days of podcasting &amp;ldquo;soundseeing tours&amp;rdquo;, wherein people just recorded the ambient sounds of interesting places they visited or things they were doing. Not much time to do a writeup on this, as I&amp;rsquo;m about to board my flight, but here you can join me on my customary walk from Tom Bradley International terminal across the length and breadth of the airport.</description>

      <description>Being sick on a trip is the worst. I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly been sleeping every spare moment I get. Managed to catch a pretty decent cheese ball of a movie, though. It was old school campy fun in the best way. Nicely captured the feel of old 80s schlock-horror movies like The Gate and Return of the Living Dead.</description>
