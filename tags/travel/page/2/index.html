<p>I made a promise to myself that I would never waste time on this blog apologizing for sporadic posting. So instead of doing that, I think I&rsquo;ll do that other thing where I throw a few pictures at you and catch you up on recent developments.</p>

	  <p>I decided to do something today I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do for quite a while. I&rsquo;m bringing back what they used to call in the early days of podcasting &ldquo;soundseeing tours&rdquo;, wherein people just recorded the ambient sounds of interesting places they visited or things they were doing. Not much time to do a writeup on this, as I&rsquo;m about to board my flight, but here you can join me on my customary walk from Tom Bradley International terminal across the length and breadth of the airport.</p>
<p>Along the way are a few surprises. See if you can spot</p>
<ul>
<li>Neil Diamond</li>
<li>Clicking heels of an army of Korean flight attendants</li>
<li>A random dude that just happened to be playing the piano as I passed by</li>
<li>A very special pit stop</li>
<li>Natalie Merchant</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Enjoy!</em></p>

<p>I have decided that when presented with a choice between the familiar and the new, I am going to lean in favor of new experiences.</p>

<p>Today I had a lot of reminders that there are people out there who love and care for me a great deal. My wife, parents, and children. My brothers, cousins, and family. Friends old and new. I am thankful for all of them. I am thankful for the things I have, inside and out. I am thankful for the places God has brought me to in the past year.</p>
<p>I met a man on the street named Emery Lambus who asked me for a couple of bucks to buy lunch. I think he mentioned something about sausages, oddly enough. We were outside the Cheesecake Factory. <a href="https://patch.com/california/santamonica/amp/25774040/you-can-fight-back-mental-illness">Emery is a homeless artist</a>. He was in a wheelchair, surrounded by about four or five of his paintings. I bought this one from him. It&rsquo;s a self portrait. I liked it because it looked so much like him. It&rsquo;s hard to really capture the essence of someone&rsquo;s face in a painting. But he did it. I can&rsquo;t tell exactly what it&rsquo;s painted on, but it looks like some sort of metal bucket lid whose sides have been flattened outwards to look like the petals of a large flower. He even signed it for me.</p>
<p>Like a lot of homeless people it seems he&rsquo;s a pretty troubled guy. But he struggles every day to keep things together, doing what he can to support himself and get by. I don&rsquo;t know about all of that. All I know is that he seemed like a decent guy who was happy to talk and show off his stuff. He was very proud that he&rsquo;d recently been given the honor of addressing the graduates of the SoCal Art Institute. They presented him with a special award. He took himself seriously, and I appreciated that.</p>
<p>When this gig is finally over, I&rsquo;ll have Emery&rsquo;s friendly, smiling face as a keepsake from Pasadena.</p>
<p>Happy birthday to me.</p>

<p>The streets of Old Town Pasadena are lined this April in pink and purple blooms. A little natural spring beauty. Something of a birthday treat from God.</p>
