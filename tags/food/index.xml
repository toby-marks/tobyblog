&lt;p&gt;It was a rainy, Seattle-y Saturday morning in Dallas when I decided to take the kids out for a Daddy-Daughter-Baby Day run to Hypnotic Donuts, one of those fancy donut places that seem to be popping up around town these days like vape shops were five about years ago. They&#39;d been asking me to take them on a Pokémon hunt, and I decided I&#39;d treat them to breakfast as a bonus and incentive for getting up extra early.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have decided that when presented with a choice between the familiar and the new, I am going to lean in favor of new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Taco Libre</title>

&lt;p&gt;The weather was warmer today. I could feel spring in my bones. I get that way around this time of year. Maybe I was feeling a little homesick. Whatever the case, I&#39;ve been craving Mexican food. I noticed this little while walking around during my lunch break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was standing outside the door reading the posted menuboard, an older lady passing by said to me &amp;ldquo;Go in. You&#39;ll like it. It&#39;s really good.&amp;rdquo; I took that as a sign.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Good Times at the El Portal</title>

&lt;p&gt;I took a detour that night after my trip to the antique store. I passed along back streets, out of the way plazas, anywhere that looked like it might afford me new scenery. I stumbled across El Portal behind the headquarters of the Planetary Society, its aromas drawing my attention before I&#39;d even rounded the corner to lay site on the place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What should I say? What can I say? Perhaps a little about where I find myself these days. What I&#39;m up to. Best keep it brief. I want to encourage myself to update these pages a little more frequently this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Remember Taco Naan, the Mexican-Indian hybrid restaurant &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/taco-naan-review/&#34;&gt;I wrote about&lt;/a&gt; a long time back? I&#39;m talking about the very same one my buddy &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/03/texas-taco-challenge-taco-naan-vs-fuel.html&#34;&gt;Brian featured&lt;/a&gt; on his second trip to the Big D, where he stacked up its offerings against the nationally renowned taco dive Fuel City. Well, they&#39;re still around and busier and better than ever! The place is expanding like mad, doubling its interior floor space and hopefully renovating those dismal restrooms. I wouldn&#39;t know because I&#39;ve never had the courage to try them again. But you don&#39;t go to Taco Naan to use the bathroom, man, so no worries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>After a long hiatus, my front seat food review series is back! This time I feature some of the Waco area&#39;s finest gas station Czech cuisine. If you&#39;re ever in the area you should absolutely stop at one or both of these fine establishments. Such a treat.

      <description>After taking some time off to contemplate the overwhelming success of my Burger King poop tweet*, we now return to our regularly scheduled programming.
In truth October is always a busy month for us and I don&#39;t have much spare time for blogging. This past Halloween was without a doubt the best yet, but I&#39;ll save that retrospective for another day. For today we find ourselves at the end of November, as grand a month as any.</description>

      <description>My buddy Brian Hammons over at Review the World requested another video food review, so I though I&#39;d introduce him to a down-home treat from my childhood. I hope you&#39;re happy with the results. I&#39;m not gonna lie, this one is a bit of a deep dive; a little something for my hardcore devotees. That is, people that like watching me eat stuff in my car. And yes, I manage to add yet another stain to my car seat.</description>

      <description>New Orleans is, of course, a city known for its food, home to some of the best chefs in the country. I was in town recently, so I figured I&#39;d check out some of the local establishments and give you guys a virtual sight-tasting tour. Let&#39;s start with the hotel vending machine.Hey, I hadn&#39;t eaten all day and I had a couple of hours to kill till my family showed up.</description>
