      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not a contest but every generation has to confront its own evil because there is something deeply wrong with human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason for the existence of shows like Hunters is the same reason why &lt;a href=&#34;https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law&#34;&gt;Godwin had to come up with his &amp;ldquo;Law.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to do with the laziness of screenwriters, though that does play into it. In the absence of religious faith Hitler and the Nazis &lt;em&gt;have taken the place of the devil in our collective mythology.&lt;/em&gt; Nazis are inhuman and irredeemably evil bogeymen who we can blame and hate and kill with impunity (at least in our works of fiction). In fact, not to do so would be a moral transgression. The only thing comparable in pop culture would be zombies, but that&amp;rsquo;s another story, and with a different meaning and message.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
