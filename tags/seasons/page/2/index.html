      Greetings, friends! It&rsquo;s been a few days since my last update, but I haven&rsquo;t been idle. Have you noticed how early the stores are stocking for Halloween this year? I blogged about my first sighting at At Home&nbsp;(formerly Garden Ridge)&nbsp;which was on July 1st, a full one month earlier than last year. (And if you&rsquo;re interested, that was at a chain called Home Goods, where the theme of ravens &amp; blackbirds predominated.

      Garden Ridge recently declared bankruptcy, and are now being reincorporated as At Home. But true to form, the seasons still come early there and stay late.
My dear wife noticed yesterday that one of the nearby stores had been refurbished, so we decided to drop in and check it out. I of course had high hopes for what to expect, and I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed.

Indeed, Halloween and fall are in full swing there.

      Technically spotted on July 1 at Michaels. Thanks to The Swagger Mom for the tip-off about fall going up this week. That made me wonder, and my suspicions checked out.&nbsp;

And yeah, it was mostly generic fall decorations on a couple of shelves, but over on the other side of the store, on a lonely end cap display, there was this:

Unmistakable. Halloween ribbon.

Frankensteins, witches, spiders, skeletons… Have you ever stopped to think how rich Halloween is in iconography?
