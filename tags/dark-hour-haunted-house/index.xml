&lt;p&gt;2015 was the year I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/20150921-the-dark-hour-best-haunt-ever/&#34;&gt;Dark Hour Haunted House&lt;/a&gt;, and you probably realize by now what a fan I am. We are very fortunate to live in an area with access to a year round haunt. To be able to be successful at that requires a level of quality and showmanship, frankly, above your average haunt. Not to detract from anyone else in the business (no one can do it all!), but I think it does hold true. In getting to know these guys and the haunt itself a little better over these past few months, it is becoming clear how much of an inspiration they are to other folks in the industry. And I&amp;rsquo;ve still not yet discovered all they have to offer!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Dark Hour - Best Haunt Ever!</title>

&lt;p&gt;I discovered The Dark Hour in March, at St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day of all times, and I fell in love. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the skills to work there, but I think if I could just secretly sneak in and live there, I would. I&amp;rsquo;d be like that weird guy from the movies who lives between the walls somehow, and you hear him rummaging around in the fridge at night. Just hope I don&amp;rsquo;t get caught! Cause you know, awkward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This year I attended Texas Frightmare Weekend for the first time. By now it seems like forever ago. But lucky you — I saved all the pictures! So here they are without much verbal adornment, or it&amp;rsquo;d probably take me another month and a half to get this up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
