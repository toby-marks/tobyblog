      <description>The soul has to make a choice, and the outcome will either break it into pieces or enable it to sail to its destination in God. And the choice comes down to this: Will the soul accept or reject suffering? Will it make this suffering its own, or struggle against it, seeing it as something alien to itself?
&amp;hellip;If he chooses to accept his suffering, he must embrace it with the wholeness of his life; he must discover and accept the proper relation to his suffering.</description>

      <description>Today in church I prostrated myself, whuch is to say I bowed deeply, with knees and forehead touching the floor, to my spiritual fathers and to every single other person present, and asked forgiveness for the things I have done that caused them offense. And they in turn asked me. The little kids. The old folks. My personal friends, and people to whom I&amp;rsquo;ve never spoken a word. We forgave each other, and reminded each other that God forgives.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today is Ash Wednesday, the Catholic holy day that begins the penitential season of Lent. This year I will not be celebrating as a Catholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year on September 1st Kassi and I, after a long season of spiritual apathy and suffering, took our first steps into the Russian Orthodox Church. There were private reasons, of course. Personal reasons that are always at the core of any conversion; but also open reasons. We did not take the step lightly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Vermeule to Newman</title>
      <link>http://tobyblog.com/posts/20181026-from-vermeule-to-newman/</link>

      <description>Even if Francis is a liberal, it is far from clear to us that the proper response is liberalism. This, then, is the crux of the problem. Barring the Head of the Church returning, there will be other popes. Perhaps some will be, in the words of the great Louisiana philosopher and theologian I.J. Reilly, good authoritarian popes. Perhaps some will be liberals. However, the anti-liberal position works as well with a good authoritarian pope as it does with a liberal pope.</description>

&lt;p&gt;ðŸ“–  Revelation 17, KJV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
