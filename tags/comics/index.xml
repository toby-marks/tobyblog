      <description>He adds the popularity of the genre among adults suggests a &amp;ldquo;kind of deliberate, self-imposed state of emotional arrest&amp;rdquo;.
And his criticism extends to creators.
He says superheroes are written and drawn by people who&amp;rsquo;ve never stood up for their own rights against the companies that employ them - saying they appear &amp;ldquo;to be largely employed as cowardice compensators&amp;rdquo;.
 I&amp;rsquo;ve made the same remark before. Not so much that it&amp;rsquo;s weird to see individual people my age obsessing over Star Wars or comic book movies or Lord of the Rings — people after all are going to have their own quirky passions — but that it&amp;rsquo;s weird to see the entire adult culture obsessing over such things, which after all were for nerds.</description>
