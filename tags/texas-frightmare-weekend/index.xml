&lt;p&gt;Do you remember &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/20150410-a-visit-to-collectors-crypt/&#34;&gt;Collector&amp;rsquo;s Crypt?&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about that place around this time last year. It&amp;rsquo;s closed now. I had a dream about it the other night, or rather its next incarnation, which was as a hybrid Christmas/Halloween store. I know the owners have an interest in Christmas things, so that detail is not too surprising. But in my dream, there was also a functional toilet over by the register. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what that was supposed to mean.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
