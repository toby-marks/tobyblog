      <description>#pic { display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; }   Do you remember Collector&#39;s Crypt? I wrote about that place around this time last year. It&#39;s closed now. I had a dream about it the other night, or rather its next incarnation, which was as a hybrid Christmas/Halloween store. I know the owners have an interest in Christmas things, so that detail is not too surprising. But in my dream, there was also a functional toilet over by the register.</description>
