      <description>&lt;p&gt;Joined once again by nostalgia blogger and good friend Brian Hammons of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;reviewtheworld.com&lt;/a&gt;, Augie and I team up to complete our trilogy of Skittles reviews, this time looking at the legendary and rarely sighted Cauldron Skittles variety, now in its second year on store shelves. Does the candy itself live up to the promise of its bright orange bag? We find out, and the answer may just &lt;em&gt;shock&lt;/em&gt; you. (It probably won&amp;rsquo;t.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join me, Augie, and superpal Brian of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;Review the World&lt;/a&gt; for installment number two in this soon to be &lt;em&gt;classic&lt;/em&gt; trilogy of Skittles candy reviews. This time we look at Brightside Skittles, the very flipside of the Darkside &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/04/skittles-four-ways.html&#34;&gt;reviewed a couple of years back&lt;/a&gt; with Brian on his last visit to Dallas. A great theme for summer and sunny days, will Brightside warm your tummy as we slip into fall and all things pumpkin spice? Find out for yourself, as we find out for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello again, folks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been a while now since I&amp;rsquo;ve been active on this site, but life has not held still for me and the family. Since the last time I posted anything of significance, quite a great deal has happened, actually, much of which was originally destined for publication here. Well, as it does, life got in the way, priorities shifted, my free time diminished, etc. etc. — and the gist of it all is that you folks were left unattended for many months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
