      <description>Who&amp;rsquo;s ready for fall?&#xA;You can count me in, though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure &amp;ldquo;ready&amp;rdquo; is the best word for it. Summer seemed to pass by so fast this year. Barely had time to really enjoy it, it seems, before it&amp;rsquo;s practically gone. They say this happens as you get older, but I suspect in my case it has more to do with a dearth of time spent outside this year, soaking up sun and heat.</description>

      <description>Arrived in beautiful Telluride, Colorado, and yes, this is my first update since day #2 of vacation. So much for my Travel Log. Between lack of cell signal and surrendering my phone to the kid, and straight up being too busy and/or exhausted, I haven‚Äôt had much opportunity for posting.&#xA;We‚Äôve been busy!&#xA;Back to the Grand Canyon this year, and this time we got to spend a night in the park, with a chance to do some dawn/dusk shots of the canyon itself.</description>

      <description>Finally made it to Red Rock State Park, and made a couple of new discoveries along the way. Our route took us through what turned out be the incredibly beautiful Coconino National Forest, a place we have vowed to return. If Tolkien‚Äôs Elves were a real thing, they might just choose to live in a place like that. Verdant green forests around the bases of giant granite mountains, interspersed all along the way with little villages and expensive looking cabin retreats, with lights hanging from the trees across bridges that span crystal clear mountain streams.</description>

      <description>On the road from Albuquerque to Flagstaff, near which we turn south to Red Rock State Park in Arizona. The kids are keen to get in a hike today, the first ‚Äúreal‚Äù day of our vacation, as far as I‚Äôm concerned. It‚Äôs been fun watching the younger two get excited over taking pictures from the car with the little Instax Mini. That was Kassi‚Äôs great idea. We bought Anthony around 150 exposures and his eyes got wide when I told him I wanted him to use every single one by the end of the trip.</description>
