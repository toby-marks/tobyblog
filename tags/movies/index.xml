      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had this song stuck in my head for a couple of days, and maybe if I post it I can get rid of it. It&amp;rsquo;s from The Jerk, and features Bernadette Peters, my first screen crush when I was just a little kid. That bit at the end where she pulls out the coronet still cracks me up. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s a touching scene, don&amp;rsquo;t you think? A little reminder that life can be sweet sometimes.</description>

      <description>The Sonic the Hedgehog movie comes out this year.
Are you hyped, nostalgia boys?!
Because if you look at this poster and get hyped, I&amp;rsquo;m calling the cops. Seriously, who designed this freakish movie poster and why is he/she not in jail/hell?</description>

      <description>Here you go, folks, the real star of Phantasm â€” that bad-ass muscle car! A real thing of beauty, and I&amp;rsquo;m not even that much of a car guy.
