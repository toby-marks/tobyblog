      <description>After taking some time off to contemplate the overwhelming success of my Burger King poop tweet*, we now return to our regularly scheduled programming.
In truth October is always a busy month for us and I don&#39;t have much spare time for blogging. This past Halloween was without a doubt the best yet, but I&#39;ll save that retrospective for another day. For today we find ourselves at the end of November, as grand a month as any.</description>

      <description>Garden Ridge recently declared bankruptcy, and are now being reincorporated as At Home. But true to form, the seasons still come early there and stay late.My dear wife noticed yesterday that one of the nearby stores had been refurbished, so we decided to drop in and check it out. I of course had high hopes for what to expect, and I wasn&#39;t disappointed.Indeed, Halloween and fall are in full swing there.</description>

      <description>Aren&#39;t I lucky? How many guys get to have a truly one of a kind candy made just for them?What you are looking at is an out of this world treat that I have dubbed &amp;ldquo;Anniversary Candy&amp;rdquo;. Made by my wife, purely for my own enjoyment.She made the first batch a few years ago for Christmas, and it&#39;s been a special request of mine ever since on celebratory occasions.Â This batch was made with almond butter, pecans, cashews, macadamia nuts, honey, and chocolate.</description>
