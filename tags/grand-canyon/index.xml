      <description>Who&amp;rsquo;s ready for fall?
You can count me in, though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure &amp;ldquo;ready&amp;rdquo; is the best word for it. Summer seemed to pass by so fast this year. Barely had time to really enjoy it, it seems, before it&amp;rsquo;s practically gone. They say this happens as you get older, but I suspect in my case it has more to do with a dearth of time spent outside this year, soaking up sun and heat.</description>
