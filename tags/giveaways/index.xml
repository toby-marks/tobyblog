      <description>Would you like to win this original 8 x 10 photograph that hung in our house this past Halloween? It&#39;s a portrait inspired by my all-time favorite Halloween blog, The Skull and Pumpkin of Mike Cathcart&#39;s. The updates have been spotty over these past few years, but the back content is well worth discovering for yourself. If you do take a look, be sure to leave a comment in appreciation.</description>
