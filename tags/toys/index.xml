Could this be the start of a grand birthday tradition? Watch me unbox the second giant care package gifted to me by my cousin, friend, and frequent collaborator â€” &lt;em&gt;Carl!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My cousin Carl, &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/sfanthor-house-of-wax/&#34;&gt;as previously featured on Tobyblog&lt;/a&gt;, sent this to me for my birthday. Get a load. It&amp;rsquo;s almost like he knows me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lights Out For Collector&#39;s Crypt</title>

      <description>#pic { display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; }   Do you remember Collector&#39;s Crypt? I wrote about that place around this time last year. It&#39;s closed now. I had a dream about it the other night, or rather its next incarnation, which was as a hybrid Christmas/Halloween store. I know the owners have an interest in Christmas things, so that detail is not too surprising. But in my dream, there was also a functional toilet over by the register.</description>

      <description>Dr. Channard from Hellraiser II, in all his glory
  Collector&amp;rsquo;s Crypt is a boutique shop in Dallas specializing in horror and sci-fi collectibles, memorabilia, paraphernalia, andâ€¦ well, you just gotta see it, folks. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing place. I discovered them only recently after attending the St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Slay Weekend event at Dark Hour Haunted House in Plano. They were a sponsor of that particular show, so Dark Hour graciously gave them some floor space to sell a few wares after the show and otherwise promote the store.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I took the kids to the amazing Retropalooza convention in Arlington, Texas, and boy did we have a blast! There were loads and loads of dealer tables with some very cool nostalgia items on display, classic and rare games galore, cosplayers, and even a few YouTube celebrities. Take a look at some of the fun things we discovered.
The owner of Tendril here was willing to let him go for a meagre forty dollars, making it the best deal I found.</description>

      <title>A Visit To The Toy Store</title>

      <description>The great thing about being a dad to small kids is that you always have a built-in excuse to be in the toy aisle. And if you have your kids with you then nobody looks twice at you as you gawk at all the amazing stuff on the store shelves these days. We are living in a golden age for toys and board games. Sure, there were a lot of really cool toys that I miss from the seventies and eighties that I wish my kids had a chance to experience, but today&#39;s market offers a certain quality and vast variety of toys and other amusements that the old days could never touch.</description>
