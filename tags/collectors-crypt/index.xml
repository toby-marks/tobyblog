      <description>#pic { display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; }   Do you remember Collector&#39;s Crypt? I wrote about that place around this time last year. It&#39;s closed now. I had a dream about it the other night, or rather its next incarnation, which was as a hybrid Christmas/Halloween store. I know the owners have an interest in Christmas things, so that detail is not too surprising. But in my dream, there was also a functional toilet over by the register.</description>

      <description>This year I attended Texas Frightmare Weekend for the first time. By now it seems like forever ago. But lucky you — I saved all the pictures! So here they are without much verbal adornment, or it&#39;d probably take me another month and a half to get this up.

I suggest you take your time with this post. It&#39;s a big one. Really savor the photographs. Left-click to enlarge them.</description>

      <description>Dr. Channard from Hellraiser II, in all his gloryCollector&#39;s Crypt is a boutique shop in Dallas specializing in horror and sci-fi collectibles, memorabilia, paraphernalia, and… well, you just gotta see it, folks. It&#39;s an amazing place. I discovered them only recently after attending the St. Patrick&#39;s Slay Weekend event at Dark Hour Haunted House in Plano. They were a sponsor of that particular show, so Dark Hour graciously gave them some floor space to sell a few wares after the show and otherwise promote the store.</description>
