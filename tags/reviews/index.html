  <p>
    
      <p>After taking some time off to contemplate the overwhelming success of my Burger King poop tweet*, we now return to our regularly scheduled programming.</p>

<p>In truth October is always a busy month for us and I don&rsquo;t have much spare time for blogging. This past Halloween was without a doubt the best yet, but I&rsquo;ll save that retrospective for another day. For today we find ourselves at the end of November, as grand a month as any. November is when fall really kicks in North Texas, and although it wasn&rsquo;t much compared to the gorgeous fall of 2013, we still managed to get some decent color in a few spots. November to me means the start of prime geocaching season, the arrival of a certain coffee chain&rsquo;s special Thanksgiving blend, (something I genuinely anticipate all year), and most of all our sumptuous Thanksgiving feast, lovingly prepared by my very talented wife. Thanksgiving is a fine holiday, too often neglected these days.</p>

<p>It is a real American holiday, in the truest and best sense.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t intended at the start of my little vacation to do a Thanksgiving special. That was TheVCubeSolver&rsquo;s idea. But I thought it was a good one. And next year we may do a Christmas Special — who knows? I hope you like it. It&rsquo;s got some outdoors, some indoors, some geocaching, some product reviews, and a very special guest cooking segment by my brother Randy as he cooks up a mess of deer balls.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>And Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

      <p>This video is something of a personal achievement, having been now just under two years in the making, and passing, as it does, yet another milestone in the revitalization of this little blog. Yeah, I know, that&rsquo;s sort of a grandiose way to introduce a video where I discuss the merits of quail eggs and potato chips with friends and family, but there we are. It means something to me — hard to quantify — to be active on the site again. Time slips away from us so fast.</p>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just that time of year, but I find myself in a contemplative mood tonight.</p>

<p>Part of the reason I took up this little adventure in the first place was that I saw the value in capturing these moments. I know they&rsquo;ll be important for later.</p>

<p><em>You</em> tune in for the straight dope on <strong>Texas versus Louisiana quail eggs</strong>. (Who has the better take?)</p>

<p><em>You</em> tune in for the verdict on <strong>Zapp&rsquo;s Voodoo Heat potato chips</strong>. (Are they kicked up to notches unknown? Or all too known?)</p>

<p><em>You</em> tune in for the word on Swamp Pop&rsquo;s strawberry soda, <strong>Pop Rouge</strong>. (I think I used to live down the street from that guy.)</p>

<p><em>I</em> tune in for a glimpse of my son at 16 years old. An old friend too long away. A summer day gone by. That&rsquo;s the essence of real nostalgia, right? It&rsquo;s always personal.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>The weather was warmer today. I could feel spring in my bones. I get that way around this time of year. Maybe I was feeling a little homesick. Whatever the case, I&rsquo;ve been craving Mexican food. I noticed this little while walking around during my lunch break.</p>

<p>As I was standing outside the door reading the posted menuboard, an older lady passing by said to me &ldquo;Go in. You&rsquo;ll like it. It&rsquo;s really good.&rdquo; I took that as a sign.</p>

<p>I took a detour that night after my trip to the antique store. I passed along back streets, out of the way plazas, anywhere that looked like it might afford me new scenery. I stumbled across El Portal behind the headquarters of the Planetary Society, its aromas drawing my attention before I&rsquo;d even rounded the corner to lay site on the place.</p>
