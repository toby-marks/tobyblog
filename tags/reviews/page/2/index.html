<p>Remember Taco Naan, the Mexican-Indian hybrid restaurant <a href="http://tobyblog.com/posts/taco-naan-review/">I wrote about</a> a long time back? I&rsquo;m talking about the very same one my buddy <a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/03/texas-taco-challenge-taco-naan-vs-fuel.html">Brian featured</a> on his second trip to the Big D, where he stacked up its offerings against the nationally renowned taco dive Fuel City. Well, they&rsquo;re still around and busier and better than ever! The place is expanding like mad, doubling its interior floor space and hopefully renovating those dismal restrooms. I wouldn&rsquo;t know because I&rsquo;ve never had the courage to try them again. But you don&rsquo;t go to Taco Naan to use the bathroom, man, so no worries.</p>

      After a long hiatus, my front seat food review series is back! This time I feature some of the Waco area&rsquo;s finest gas station Czech cuisine. If you&rsquo;re ever in the area you should absolutely stop at one or both of these fine establishments. Such a treat.

      Beer is great year-round, but summer brings its own varieties. I noticed recently that hard ciders are becoming more popular. I had a chance to sample a new one from Ace, makers of an outstanding pumpkin cider that I am very much looking forward to having again this fall. Their pear cider, available in all seasons, merits a future review. But this one I had not seen before.
Indeed, it called out to me from the shelf with unabashed summery fruitiness.

      After taking some time off to contemplate the overwhelming success of my Burger King poop tweet*, we now return to our regularly scheduled programming.
In truth October is always a busy month for us and I don&rsquo;t have much spare time for blogging. This past Halloween was without a doubt the best yet, but I&rsquo;ll save that retrospective for another day. For today we find ourselves at the end of November, as grand a month as any.

      Celebrating our third anniversary of Buddy Team reviews, TheVCubeSolver and I team up to tackle the legendary Sprechers Root Beer. It&rsquo;s good stuff!

      Straight off a Dollar Store shelf at the lovely Grapevine Mills Mall in Grapevine, Texas, and stocked just a few bins over from the storied Orchard Skittles, comes Kranky Candy, the coffee dusted confection you will soon come to know and love. Is it an afternoon snack? A breakfast substitute? Repurposed industrial by-product? You decide.
Joining me in his first proper appearance* on Tobyblog is my good friend Brian Hammons of ReviewTheWorld.

      Once again we were proud to host buddy Brian Hammons of the food/candy/retro/life blog Review the World as he made his way down to Dallas for the big UFC 185 fight night. What a weekend! Among other things, I introduced Brian Hammons to some of the best tacos in the COUNTRY. Go see what resulted over on reviewtheworld.com.
