      Straight off a Dollar Store shelf at the lovely Grapevine Mills Mall in Grapevine, Texas, and stocked just a few bins over from the storied Orchard Skittles, comes Kranky Candy, the coffee dusted confection you will soon come to know and love. Is it an afternoon snack? A breakfast substitute? Repurposed industrial by-product? You decide.
Joining me in his first proper appearance* on Tobyblog is my good friend Brian Hammons of ReviewTheWorld.

	  Once again we were proud to host buddy Brian Hammons of the food/candy/retro/life blog Review the World as he made his way down to Dallas for the big UFC 185 fight night. What a weekend! Among other things, I introduced Brian Hammons to some of the best tacos in the COUNTRY. Go see what resulted over on reviewtheworld.com.

	  We have reached "Peak Blogger" in this society, folks. If the existence of Tobyblog was not proof of that already, take a look at the above picture. It was a cold, blustery Saturday afternoon and I was visiting nearby Arlington. It was around lunchtime and I had some time to kill, so I decided to walk over to the nearby strip mall and scope out the restaurants. There were a surprising number of cuisines on offer for such a small area, but this place caught my eye.

	  Those of you paying close attention&nbsp;will remember that Tobyblog owes its existence to my good buddy Brian Hammons of the nostalgia blog&nbsp;reviewtheworld.com. His site is a surprisingly deep personal catalog that is as much a call to action and personal philosophical movement as anything. Brian has been at this game for far longer than YouTube has been around, and has amassed an unparalleled amount of footage and articles documenting the greater part of his life, from high school hijinks to romances come and gone, to thirty-something introspections with friends.

      <p>I love Halloween. You do, too. This video is a tribute to that season, to every memory and every thrill. To cold autumn nights. To the warm glow of jack o' lanterns. To spooky stories and cozy evenings. To every bit of magic and adventure in our lives.</p>
<p>This is the story of Halloween 2013 as we experienced it; what has gone down in our lives and memories as <strong>THE BEST HALLOWEEN EVER</strong>. See TheVCubeSolver and I review some spooky sparkly sodas. <em>Thrills!</em> Listen to me ramble on about my pumpkin carving kit. <em>Ooh! Chills!</em> Take a peek at the dark miracle that is the Little Elm Halloween Festival. <em>Bigger and better than ever this year!</em></p>
<p>The Tobyblog Halloween special has <em>sights</em> and <em>sounds!</em></p>
<p>The Tobyblog Halloween special has <em>scares</em> and <em>delights!</em></p>
<p>The Tobyblog Halloween special will make you laugh and make you cry!</p>
<p><em>The Tobyblog Halloween Special is a family celebration.</em> Enjoy.</p>
