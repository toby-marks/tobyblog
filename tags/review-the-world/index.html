      Joined once again by nostalgia blogger and good friend Brian Hammons of reviewtheworld.com, Augie and I team up to complete our trilogy of Skittles reviews, this time looking at the legendary and rarely sighted Cauldron Skittles variety, now in its second year on store shelves. Does the candy itself live up to the promise of its bright orange bag? We find out, and the answer may just shock you. (It probably won&rsquo;t.

      <p>Join me, Augie, and superpal Brian of <a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/">Review the World</a> for installment number two in this soon to be <em>classic</em> trilogy of Skittles candy reviews. This time we look at Brightside Skittles, the very flipside of the Darkside <a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/04/skittles-four-ways.html">reviewed a couple of years back</a> with Brian on his last visit to Dallas. A great theme for summer and sunny days, will Brightside warm your tummy as we slip into fall and all things pumpkin spice? Find out for yourself, as we find out for ourselves.</p>

      Hello again, folks.
It has been a while now since I&rsquo;ve been active on this site, but life has not held still for me and the family. Since the last time I posted anything of significance, quite a great deal has happened, actually, much of which was originally destined for publication here. Well, as it does, life got in the way, priorities shifted, my free time diminished, etc. etc. — and the gist of it all is that you folks were left unattended for many months.

	  It&rsquo;s that time of year again folks, that magical time between Christmas and New Year where thoughtful commentators like myself come out with their end of year retrospectives; and continuing a tradition I established a couple of years back on this site, I intend to give you my take on the best of my buddy Brian Hammons&rsquo; output over on the internet&rsquo;s most beloved nostalgia blog, ReviewTheWorld.com.
You can catch up on previous years&rsquo; content by taking a look at my other lists:

	  I discovered The Dark Hour in March, at St. Patrick's Day of all times, and I fell in love. I don't have the skills to work there, but I think if I could just secretly sneak in and live there, I would. I'd be like that weird guy from the movies who lives between the walls somehow, and you hear him rummaging around in the fridge at night. Just hope I don't get caught!
