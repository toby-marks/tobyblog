<p>Picture of me in the Llano Estacado, Texas’s “wine country”. On the road for quite a while and still not out of the state. Holding up well. Fear the little one may be coming down with a cold. Hope he’s better after some rest.</p>

<p>Changed restaurant plans and will revisit our old favorite in Albuquerque for the third year in a row.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tobyblog/image/upload/a_0/v1564718915/img/2BC3A181-05ED-476E-9231-0163072E2684_mcgwmk.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The food there has always been great, though the service is consistently slow. Had a very nice steak dinner and a just-OK Old Fashioned. I think I’m spoiled at the Wildwood back home.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we hike at Red Rock State Park. Should be warm, but can’t possibly be as uncomfortably humid as when we left Dallas. Gonna try and grab some shut-eye. Real vacation starts tomorrow morning!</p>

	  <p>The second installment in my ongoing series of ambient environmental sound recordings. These are the sounds of me packing up my recorder and walking to the food court, where I order a bowl from Chipotle. I take my bowl outside to the patio to enjoy the fresh air and sunshine, after which I take a little walk around the mall to pick up some interesting sounds. And for the second time in a row I ran across a guy playing a piano. Coincidence? Not sure, but it would be cool if that happened every time and everywhere I tried this.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy.</p>

<p>I made a promise to myself that I would never waste time on this blog apologizing for sporadic posting. So instead of doing that, I think I&rsquo;ll do that other thing where I throw a few pictures at you and catch you up on recent developments.</p>

	  <p>If you haven&rsquo;t been following Kassi over on her personal blog, by all means go there and check it out. She&rsquo;s been killing it lately, posting about all the family stuff I&rsquo;m supposed to be getting to over on this site, but have been too lame to do. I swear she can fire off 3 or 4 posts by the time I&rsquo;m done editing the same number of photos. Practice, I guess? Her latest one about the John Muir books she&rsquo;s been collecting has put me in a very vacation-y kind of mood. I thought it was funny that she called me out for still working on photos from two years ago, which is true. But I have learned (what I think is) a whole lot in the meantime, and my camera and software suite, and hopefully my editing sensibilities, have evolved a great deal in that time. It&rsquo;s been fun revisiting those not-so-old photos and reminiscing on the times we spent out on the road in some very rugged country. I&rsquo;d honestly forgotten just how pretty it was up in Colorado the summer of 2017. Anyway, enjoy the blog and hopefully get inspired yourself. John Muir was a great man, one of this nation&rsquo;s finest. And more to come here on all that as well.</p>
