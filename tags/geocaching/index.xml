&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What the pack?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin Carl, &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/sfanthor-house-of-wax/&#34;&gt;as previously featured on Tobyblog&lt;/a&gt;, sent this to me for my birthday. Get a load. It&amp;rsquo;s almost like he knows me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>After taking some time off to contemplate the overwhelming success of my Burger King poop tweet*, we now return to our regularly scheduled programming.
In truth October is always a busy month for us and I don&amp;rsquo;t have much spare time for blogging. This past Halloween was without a doubt the best yet, but I&amp;rsquo;ll save that retrospective for another day. For today we find ourselves at the end of November, as grand a month as any.</description>

      <description>The Super Mega Fun Pack geocache (GC5Z4X7) is a thinly-veiled tribute to Matt of dinosaurdracula.com and the amazing box of goodies that he puts together every month for his hordes of devoted fans. It&amp;rsquo;s only &amp;ldquo;veiled&amp;rdquo; at all because of the (understandable) policy of geocaching.com not to list any cache with references to commercial products. After going back and forth with them a bit about this, I relented and removed any overt references to Matt or his website, including changing the name of the cache from the original &amp;ldquo;The Dino Drac Fun Pack Geocache&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Super Mega Fun Pack&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>TheVCubeSolver and I hit the road on a pretty March morning to do some maintenance on a couple of our geocaches. The log for RtW #3 had filled up and Augie&amp;rsquo;s beaver cache had recently been reported missing. A little town, a little country. More geocaching goodness for you.

      <title>My First Night Cache</title>

      <description>Come along with the kids and I on our first night caching adventure. For the uninitiated among you, night caching is simply geocaching at night. Generally night caches are made so that you can&amp;rsquo;t find them during the daytime, by making use of trails of reflective tacks or tape or other forms of guidance visible only at night.

      <description>I like geocaching for lots of reasons. I like to be outside. I like discovering new places. I like walking and connecting with nature. But occasionally I learn something as well. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s just local historical trivia, or maybe a geography lesson. But sometimes the lesson is more personal, and as in this case, tragic.
The morning started out with a trip to the Trinity Trails in Wylie, Texas for some hiking and caching.</description>

      <title>Found Objects: Evil Zombie Clown</title>

      <description>I have no particular fear of clowns. I am not one of those people. But this thing gives me the creeps. Downright turns my stomach.
I found it in an ammo can in a small copse of woods near the office, nestled among a collection of unremarkable trinkets. It&amp;rsquo;s only about an inch or so high, so it took me a second to realize that it carries in its left hand a severed human arm.</description>

      <title>Suncreek Park - More Than Meets The Eye</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6mnC4JYvcn0/UwWCzShf6HI/AAAAAAAAAPM/y2nUzVn5A88/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-19+at+10.16.29+PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago my wife told me about a new park she had discovered while killing time between a couple of the kids&#39; classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While climbing an overpass she caught site of some paved trails just off the road that interested her enough to want to Google it later. The trails turned out to be part of Suncreek Park in Allen, Texas. The website claims Suncreek sports only four tenths of a mile of paved trails, so it&amp;rsquo;s not much for walking, hiking, or biking. It does sport some scenic views, though, as well as a handful of geocaching opportunities. One unexpected and mysterious feature deserves further exploration, as I will soon relate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
