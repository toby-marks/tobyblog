      TheVCubeSolver and I hit the road on a pretty March morning to do some maintenance on a couple of our geocaches. The log for RtW #3 had filled up and Augie&rsquo;s beaver cache had recently been reported missing. A little town, a little country. More geocaching goodness for you.

      Come along with the kids and I on our first night caching adventure. For the uninitiated among you, night caching is simply geocaching at night. Generally night caches are made so that you can&rsquo;t find them during the daytime, by making use of trails of reflective tacks or tape or other forms of guidance visible only at night.

	  HALLOWEEN LOVERS EVERYWHERE, IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THE LEMAX SPOOKY TOWN COLLECTION AT MICHAELS, FIND ONE NEAR YOU AND GO THERE.&nbsp;NOW.

I am not kidding.
I discovered the world of Lemax Village collectibles only a year ago. They also make Christmas sets, but the Halloween village is sold exclusively at Michaels. Now I&rsquo;m not normally the kind of guy that goes gaga for stuff like this, but the artistry and imagination evident in these pieces is hard to deny.

	  Greetings, friends! It&rsquo;s been a few days since my last update, but I haven&rsquo;t been idle. Have you noticed how early the stores are stocking for Halloween this year? I blogged about my first sighting at At Home&nbsp;(formerly Garden Ridge)&nbsp;which was on July 1st, a full one month earlier than last year. (And if you&rsquo;re interested, that was at a chain called Home Goods, where the theme of ravens &amp; blackbirds predominated.

	  I like geocaching for lots of reasons. I like to be outside. I like discovering new places. I like&nbsp;walking and connecting with nature. But occasionally I learn something as well. Usually it&rsquo;s just local historical trivia, or maybe a&nbsp;geography&nbsp;lesson. But sometimes the lesson is more personal, and as in this case, tragic.
The morning started out with a trip to the Trinity Trails in Wylie, Texas for some hiking and caching.
