&lt;p&gt;In other news, I saw Detective Pikachu with the family a few days ago, and I think we all left impressed. Some strong acting and genuinely funny moments. Pikachu singing the Pokémon cartoon theme song was a highlight for me. But does Ryan Reynolds have to be in literally every movie now? That being said, he did a wonderful job. A really enjoyable and charming movie. Go see it. With your kids, of course.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Happy springtime to all you players out there. The weather’s warming up here in Texas. We’re coming out of winter. I think we’re through the worst of it. Are you looking for signs of new growth? Look to the trees! They’re always the first to show.</description>
