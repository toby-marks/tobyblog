&lt;p&gt;2015 was the year I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/20150921-the-dark-hour-best-haunt-ever/&#34;&gt;Dark Hour Haunted House&lt;/a&gt;, and you probably realize by now what a fan I am. We are very fortunate to live in an area with access to a year round haunt. To be able to be successful at that requires a level of quality and showmanship, frankly, above your average haunt. Not to detract from anyone else in the business (no one can do it all!), but I think it does hold true. In getting to know these guys and the haunt itself a little better over these past few months, it is becoming clear how much of an inspiration they are to other folks in the industry. And I&amp;rsquo;ve still not yet discovered all they have to offer!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Dark Hour - Best Haunt Ever!</title>

&lt;p&gt;I discovered The Dark Hour in March, at St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day of all times, and I fell in love. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the skills to work there, but I think if I could just secretly sneak in and live there, I would. I&amp;rsquo;d be like that weird guy from the movies who lives between the walls somehow, and you hear him rummaging around in the fridge at night. Just hope I don&amp;rsquo;t get caught! Cause you know, awkward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Decorator&amp;rsquo;s Warehouse, located in Arlington, Texas, bills itself as Texas&amp;rsquo;s largest Christmas store. And it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; very large. But what really impresses you upon entering the place is just how jam-packed it is with holiday and seasonal baubles, as if despite its football-field size floor space they still did not have quite enough room to fit everything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Those of you paying &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/20140202-the-beginning/&#34;&gt;close attention&lt;/a&gt; will remember that Tobyblog owes its existence to my good buddy Brian Hammons of the nostalgia blog &lt;a href=&#34;http://reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;reviewtheworld.com&lt;/a&gt;. His site is a surprisingly deep personal catalog that is as much a call to action and personal philosophical movement as anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>There is a little independent retro gaming store in Plano that is the closest thing to a real arcade that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced with the kids. There are still a lot of places you could call &amp;ldquo;arcades&amp;rdquo;, mostly attached to chain family restaurants like Chuck-E-Cheese or entertainment complexes like Fun Zone or Amazing Jakes. But the key differentiator for me is that the machines take real quarters, preferably only one per play.</description>

      <title>Wylie&#39;s Angel</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like geocaching for lots of reasons. I like to be outside. I like discovering new places. I like walking and connecting with nature. But occasionally I learn something as well. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s just local historical trivia, or maybe a geography lesson. But sometimes the lesson is more personal, and as in this case, tragic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning started out with a trip to the Trinity Trails in Wylie, Texas for some hiking and caching. We chose to start at the easternmost trailhead, which was also the closest to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a little marina at the trailhead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Suncreek Park - More Than Meets The Eye</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6mnC4JYvcn0/UwWCzShf6HI/AAAAAAAAAPM/y2nUzVn5A88/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-19+at+10.16.29+PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago my wife told me about a new park she had discovered while killing time between a couple of the kids&#39; classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While climbing an overpass she caught site of some paved trails just off the road that interested her enough to want to Google it later. The trails turned out to be part of Suncreek Park in Allen, Texas. The website claims Suncreek sports only four tenths of a mile of paved trails, so it&amp;rsquo;s not much for walking, hiking, or biking. It does sport some scenic views, though, as well as a handful of geocaching opportunities. One unexpected and mysterious feature deserves further exploration, as I will soon relate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
