      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crows, in fact, might be like us not so much because they are clever (and so are we) but rather because they sometimes engage their cleverness simply for fun ‚Äì and so do we.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s it like to be a crow? What do they make of us? Are animals capable of moral behavior? Having been a pet owner for many years I think this is true. I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve observed it. But then again there are some folks who think that &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is capable of an existential morality, even the non-animate creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
