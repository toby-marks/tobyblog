      <description>&lt;p&gt;Things have become very busy for me over the last couple of weeks. I&amp;rsquo;ve been given primary &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/orthodoxnet/live&#34;&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/orthodoxnet&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; responsibilities for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.orthodox.net/&#34;&gt;our church&lt;/a&gt; during the lockdown, all the while ramping up for a new gig at my job, and working on an interesting side project as well ‚Äî a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/tobyjmarks/albums/72157713852595457&#34;&gt;product shoot&lt;/a&gt; for a friend at church who is opening up an Etsy store. (On a side note, I&amp;rsquo;ve never done anything like that and was honored that she even asked. I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% satisfied with the edits yet, and I could have done a better job on tamping down the glare in a few of the photos, but overall I&amp;rsquo;m happy with how they turned out. Even the glare, I think, provides the kind of natural look that she was going for in the shoot.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
