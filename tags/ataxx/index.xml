      <description>Infexxion is an iPhone game based on the old arcade game Attax. My cousin Carl introduced me to it. There was a cabinet in the lobby of a (surely long-since demolished?) movie theater in what is now a rough part of Lafayette, Louisiana. I forget what we were seeing that night. He played â€” I didn&#39;t, as I recall. It had a weird, edgy kind of quality to it, like an Exidy game.</description>
