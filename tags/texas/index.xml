      <description>Picture of me in the Llano Estacado, Texas‚Äôs ‚Äúwine country‚Äù. On the road for quite a while and still not out of the state. Holding up well. Fear the little one may be coming down with a cold. Hope he‚Äôs better after some rest.&#xA;Changed restaurant plans and will revisit our old favorite in Albuquerque for the third year in a row.&#xA;The food there has always been great, though the service is consistently slow.</description>

      <description>We‚Äôre well in to the big family road trip of 2019, and the obligatory Texas pit stop at Bucc-ees has been checked off the list. Would have sent you guys a pic from the storied Bucc-ees bathrooms, but I was too excited about these new hot n‚Äô spicy Beaver Nuggets! You can hear all about my first experience with those glorified Corn Pops in this review I did last year with my good buddy Brian.</description>
