The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.holidaywarehouse.com/&#34;&gt;Holiday Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; is a largish, and rather outstanding, independent holiday decor shop located in Plano, Texas. Like its well known cousin The &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/the-decorators-warehouse/&#34;&gt;Decorator&amp;rsquo;s Warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in Arlington, the concentration is mainly on Christmas, but not as exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The Decorator&#39;s Warehouse, located in Arlington, Texas, bills itself as Texas&#39;s largest Christmas store. And it is very large. But what really impresses you upon entering the place is just how jam-packed it is with holiday and seasonal baubles, as if despite its football-field size floor space they still did not have quite enough room to fit everything.&amp;nbsp;
As soon as you walk in the door you&#39;re assaulted with holiday cheer; the entrance is rather elaborately decorated and serves as both a picture station and portal of sorts into this alternate dimension that feels something like Santa&#39;s attic.</description>
