      <description>HALLOWEEN LOVERS EVERYWHERE, IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THE LEMAX SPOOKY TOWN COLLECTION AT MICHAELS, FIND ONE NEAR YOU AND GO THERE.&amp;nbsp;NOW.

I am not kidding.
I discovered the world of Lemax Village collectibles only a year ago. They also make Christmas sets, but the Halloween village is sold exclusively at Michaels. Now I&#39;m not normally the kind of guy that goes gaga for stuff like this, but the artistry and imagination evident in these pieces is hard to deny.</description>
