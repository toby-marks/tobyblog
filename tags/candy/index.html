      <p>Joined once again by nostalgia blogger and good friend Brian Hammons of <a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/">reviewtheworld.com</a>, Augie and I team up to complete our trilogy of Skittles reviews, this time looking at the legendary and rarely sighted Cauldron Skittles variety, now in its second year on store shelves. Does the candy itself live up to the promise of its bright orange bag? We find out, and the answer may just <em>shock</em> you. (It probably won&rsquo;t.)</p>
<p>Enjoy the video, and here&rsquo;s hoping we see more of Brian in the near future!</p>

      <p>Join me, Augie, and superpal Brian of <a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/">Review the World</a> for installment number two in this soon to be <em>classic</em> trilogy of Skittles candy reviews. This time we look at Brightside Skittles, the very flipside of the Darkside <a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/04/skittles-four-ways.html">reviewed a couple of years back</a> with Brian on his last visit to Dallas. A great theme for summer and sunny days, will Brightside warm your tummy as we slip into fall and all things pumpkin spice? Find out for yourself, as we find out for ourselves.</p>
<p>Give the video a click and enjoy.</p>

      <p>Hello again, folks.</p>
<p>It has been a while now since I&rsquo;ve been active on this site, but life has not held still for me and the family. Since the last time I posted anything of significance, quite a great deal has happened, actually, much of which was originally destined for publication here. Well, as it does, life got in the way, priorities shifted, my free time diminished, etc. etc. — and the gist of it all is that you folks were left unattended for many months.</p>
<p>Well, my hope is to change that situation, especially as we draw nearer to that weird season both blessed and profane, which has become so dear to my heart over the last several years.</p>
<p>And I <em>do</em> have things to show you.</p>
<p>I hope you will indulge me if quite a few of those things involve a short trip back in time to catch you up on all the adventures of the past year. They will be new experiences to you, at any rate, though they might necessarily arrive just a bit out of season.</p>
<p>Better late than never, as they say.</p>
<p>Which brings me to today&rsquo;s post. This June we were delighted to once again host our good friend Brian Hammons of <a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/">ReviewTheWorld.com</a> as he made his long-awaited return trip to Dallas. The story of that visit is worth a blog in itself. Needless to say, some hot summer fun, fresh eats, and review-worthy times were had by all.</p>
<p>And what better way to commemorate that occasion than by <a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/04/skittles-four-ways.html">revisiting one of my favorite joint-review projects</a> with Augie and Brian, the now traditional Skittles multi-way review, in which we launch into some new seasonal varieties promising plenty of explosive and sometimes oddball candy flavors. First up — America Skittles, filmed in plenty of time for Independence Day celebrations, but only released today, with fall peeking around the corner. Such is life.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>And, it&rsquo;s good to be back.</p>

      Straight off a Dollar Store shelf at the lovely Grapevine Mills Mall in Grapevine, Texas, and stocked just a few bins over from the storied Orchard Skittles, comes Kranky Candy, the coffee dusted confection you will soon come to know and love. Is it an afternoon snack? A breakfast substitute? Repurposed industrial by-product? You decide.
Joining me in his first proper appearance* on Tobyblog is my good friend Brian Hammons of ReviewTheWorld.

      <p>I love Halloween. You do, too. This video is a tribute to that season, to every memory and every thrill. To cold autumn nights. To the warm glow of jack o' lanterns. To spooky stories and cozy evenings. To every bit of magic and adventure in our lives.</p>
<p>This is the story of Halloween 2013 as we experienced it; what has gone down in our lives and memories as <strong>THE BEST HALLOWEEN EVER</strong>. See TheVCubeSolver and I review some spooky sparkly sodas. <em>Thrills!</em> Listen to me ramble on about my pumpkin carving kit. <em>Ooh! Chills!</em> Take a peek at the dark miracle that is the Little Elm Halloween Festival. <em>Bigger and better than ever this year!</em></p>
<p>The Tobyblog Halloween special has <em>sights</em> and <em>sounds!</em></p>
<p>The Tobyblog Halloween special has <em>scares</em> and <em>delights!</em></p>
<p>The Tobyblog Halloween special will make you laugh and make you cry!</p>
<p><em>The Tobyblog Halloween Special is a family celebration.</em> Enjoy.</p>
