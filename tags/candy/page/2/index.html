      Straight off a Dollar Store shelf at the lovely Grapevine Mills Mall in Grapevine, Texas, and stocked just a few bins over from the storied Orchard Skittles, comes Kranky Candy, the coffee dusted confection you will soon come to know and love. Is it an afternoon snack? A breakfast substitute? Repurposed industrial by-product? You decide.
Joining me in his first proper appearance* on Tobyblog is my good friend Brian Hammons of ReviewTheWorld.

  <p>
	
	  Those of you paying close attention&nbsp;will remember that Tobyblog owes its existence to my good buddy Brian Hammons of the nostalgia blog&nbsp;reviewtheworld.com. His site is a surprisingly deep personal catalog that is as much a call to action and personal philosophical movement as anything. Brian has been at this game for far longer than YouTube has been around, and has amassed an unparalleled amount of footage and articles documenting the greater part of his life, from high school hijinks to romances come and gone, to thirty-something introspections with friends.

  <p>
	
	  Already a great place to find exotic candies, foreign soda pop, and specialty food items at any time of the year (Brian Hammons, you know what I'm talking about), World Market really comes alive for Halloween. If you've got one in your area, get down there right now and check their selection. The stuff they carry is definitely outside of the Target/Big Lots/Dollar Store Halloween mold, but that's not to say it's super expensive.

      To celebrate the recent one year anniversary of our father/son Tumblr site, TheVCubeSolver and I teamed up to review an assortment of Snickers bars we found at CVS. And as a special bonus, we take a look at the trendy new Lays Cappuccino potato chips.
Enjoy.

	  Aren&rsquo;t I lucky? How many guys get to have a truly one of a kind candy made just for them?
What you are looking at is an out of this world treat that I have dubbed &ldquo;Anniversary Candy&rdquo;. Made by my wife, purely for my own enjoyment.
She made the first batch a few years ago for Christmas, and it&rsquo;s been a special request of mine ever since on celebratory occasions.
