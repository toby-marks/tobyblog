      <description>I just want to ask a question Who really cares? To save a world in despair Who really cares? There’ll come a time, when the world won’t be singing Flowers won’t grow, bells won’t be ringing Who really cares? Who’s willing to try to save a world Thats destined to die When I look at the world it fills me with sorrow Little children today are really gonna suffer tomorrow Oh, what a shame, such a bad way to live All who is to blame, we can’t stop living Live, live for life But let live everybody Live life for the children Oh, for the children You see, let’s save the children Let’s save all the children Save the babies, save the babies If you wanna love, you got to save the babies All of the children But who really cares Who’s willing to try Yea, to save a world Yea, save our sweet world Save a world that is destined to die</description>
