      <description>#pic { display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; }   Do you remember Collector&amp;rsquo;s Crypt? I wrote about that place around this time last year. It&amp;rsquo;s closed now. I had a dream about it the other night, or rather its next incarnation, which was as a hybrid Christmas/Halloween store. I know the owners have an interest in Christmas things, so that detail is not too surprising. But in my dream, there was also a functional toilet over by the register.</description>

      <description>Dr. Channard from Hellraiser II, in all his gloryCollector&#39;s Crypt is a boutique shop in Dallas specializing in horror and sci-fi collectibles, memorabilia, paraphernalia, andâ€¦ well, you just gotta see it, folks. It&#39;s an amazing place. I discovered them only recently after attending the St. Patrick&#39;s Slay Weekend event at Dark Hour Haunted House in Plano. They were a sponsor of that particular show, so Dark Hour graciously gave them some floor space to sell a few wares after the show and otherwise promote the store.</description>
