&lt;p&gt;Do you remember &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/20150410-a-visit-to-collectors-crypt/&#34;&gt;Collector&amp;rsquo;s Crypt?&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about that place around this time last year. It&amp;rsquo;s closed now. I had a dream about it the other night, or rather its next incarnation, which was as a hybrid Christmas/Halloween store. I know the owners have an interest in Christmas things, so that detail is not too surprising. But in my dream, there was also a functional toilet over by the register. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what that was supposed to mean.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Collector&amp;rsquo;s Crypt is a boutique shop in Dallas specializing in horror and sci-fi collectibles, memorabilia, paraphernalia, andâ€¦ well, you just gotta see it, folks. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing place. I discovered them only recently after attending the St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Slay Weekend event at &lt;a href=&#34;http://darkhourhauntedhouse.com/&#34;&gt;Dark Hour Haunted House&lt;/a&gt; in Plano. They were a sponsor of that particular show, so Dark Hour graciously gave them some floor space to sell a few wares after the show and otherwise promote the store. Now it&amp;rsquo;s not like Dallas has a whole lot of shops like this; in fact, I cannot think of &lt;em&gt;one other&lt;/em&gt;. So it piqued my interest. I noticed that they are located only a short distance across the river from where I currently work, so I decided to pop in on my next available lunch hour.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
