    <p>One of the little things I appreciate about Old Town Pasadena are the diagonal crosswalks. Very convenient, but they always feel like I’m stepping out into traffic. 😳🚶🏻‍♂️🚌</p>

<p>Today I had a lot of reminders that there are people out there who love and care for me a great deal. My wife, parents, and children. My brothers, cousins, and family. Friends old and new. I am thankful for all of them. I am thankful for the things I have, inside and out. I am thankful for the places God has brought me to in the past year.</p>
<p>I met a man on the street named Emery Lambus who asked me for a couple of bucks to buy lunch. I think he mentioned something about sausages, oddly enough. We were outside the Cheesecake Factory. <a href="https://patch.com/california/santamonica/amp/25774040/you-can-fight-back-mental-illness">Emery is a homeless artist</a>. He was in a wheelchair, surrounded by about four or five of his paintings. I bought this one from him. It&rsquo;s a self portrait. I liked it because it looked so much like him. It&rsquo;s hard to really capture the essence of someone&rsquo;s face in a painting. But he did it. I can&rsquo;t tell exactly what it&rsquo;s painted on, but it looks like some sort of metal bucket lid whose sides have been flattened outwards to look like the petals of a large flower. He even signed it for me.</p>
<p>Like a lot of homeless people it seems he&rsquo;s a pretty troubled guy. But he struggles every day to keep things together, doing what he can to support himself and get by. I don&rsquo;t know about all of that. All I know is that he seemed like a decent guy who was happy to talk and show off his stuff. He was very proud that he&rsquo;d recently been given the honor of addressing the graduates of the SoCal Art Institute. They presented him with a special award. He took himself seriously, and I appreciated that.</p>
<p>When this gig is finally over, I&rsquo;ll have Emery&rsquo;s friendly, smiling face as a keepsake from Pasadena.</p>
<p>Happy birthday to me.</p>
<p>🎂</p>

    <p>It’s adorable the way these Californians go on about their avocado toast. I have heard “avocado toast” dropped about five times in the last couple of days. Reminds me of the way Texans love&hellip; tacos?</p>
<p>I think I’m gonna have to eat some avocado toast before I get out of here. I’ll let you guys know.</p>
