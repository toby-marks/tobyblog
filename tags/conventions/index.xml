      <description>This year I attended Texas Frightmare Weekend for the first time. By now it seems like forever ago. But lucky you â€” I saved all the pictures! So here they are without much verbal adornment, or it&#39;d probably take me another month and a half to get this up.

I suggest you take your time with this post. It&#39;s a big one. Really savor the photographs. Left-click to enlarge them.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I took the kids to the amazing Retropalooza convention in Arlington, Texas, and boy did we have a blast! There were loads and loads of dealer tables with some very cool nostalgia items on display, classic and rare games galore, cosplayers, and even a few YouTube celebrities. Take a look at some of the fun things we discovered.
The owner of Tendril here was willing to let him go for a meagre forty dollars, making it the best deal I found.</description>
