      <title>2020 Spotify Wrapped</title>

      <description>Spotify Wrapped: 2020 Edition I thought this was worth highlighting from my listening statistics for this year.
No surprise there. I discovered her work in April and became a huge fan over the course of the year, as I mentioned once before.
But in the top 0.05% of listeners?
That surprised me a little.
I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go ahead and say that I am the NUMBER ONE Blossom Dearie fan on Spotify.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Recent events got me resurrecting an old feature of the site that I&amp;rsquo;ve neglected far too long. Today&amp;rsquo;s YouTube cover battle features Rage Against the Machine&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_in_the_Name&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Killing in the Name.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>For all you folks out there enjoying the savings and discounts, and perhaps needing a little mood music to go along with.
  You might recognize that one. It&amp;rsquo;s sort of famous. Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the entire playlist, which I don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be able to embed on my page. Maybe that doesn&amp;rsquo;t even make sense. The 1950s gave birth to shopping music, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure its bright and chipper tone has ever been topped.</description>

      <title>I Can&#39;t Get Over This Cover Album</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I discovered the The Bird and Bee this past December when I heard their rendition of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/2018-12-21-my-favorite-christmas-songs/&#34;&gt;The Twelve Days of Christmas&lt;/a&gt; at a bar in Honolulu. That led me to this album, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been burning it up lately on drives and at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7rExwCkRYI&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s total ear candy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>George Michael&#39;s Jazz Noir Album</title>

      <description>A pop take on jazz noir from his best album. Many years ago Kass and I listened to this cassette so much we broke the tape.
I hope you all are having a mellow moment, whenever it is for you. I know I am.
I find jazz noir goes best with whiskey.

      <title>A Few of My Favorite Christmas Songs</title>
      <link>http://tobyblog.com/posts/2018-12-21-my-favorite-christmas-songs/</link>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hands down my favorite Christmas song of 2018. I passed up this album in favor of Jackie Gleason&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Tis The Season&lt;/em&gt;, a purchase I do not regret, but this song is definitely worth the price of the vinyl. I love it when Frank sings melancholy, and this one has that quality in spades. Nostalgia, regret, and loneliness are all wrapped up in that golden bow of his amazing voice, a voice that forces your ears to attention when you hear it, never aging, never dulling, calling your life before your eyes, and all but materializing that glass of whiskey or scotch in your left hand, as your right hand reaches to pull the brim of your fedora down a little more to cover the tears in your eyes. Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Halloween is Officially On Hold</title>

      <description>October, you have been one long, soggy mess. C&amp;rsquo;est la vie, I suppose. To commemorate what I anticipate to be tonight&amp;rsquo;s non-event, I have chosen this song to be the official &amp;ldquo;hold&amp;rdquo; music of Halloween 2018, to be played in a continuous loop until one metaphorically throws up one&amp;rsquo;s hands in disgust, and finally gives up the game. To pick it up again next year? Perhaps. But never quite in the same way.</description>

      <title>A Frank Zappa Halloween Costume</title>
      <link>http://tobyblog.com/posts/2018-04-25-zappa-halloween-77-costume/</link>

      <description>I think I just found my Halloween costume for this year.
How did I ever miss this? It debuted just last year for the 40th anniversary celebration of Frank Zappa&amp;rsquo;s legendary Halloween concert series at The Palladium in New York. Zappa did Halloween concerts throughout the entirety of his career, but the one in 1977 is generally considered to be the apogee of that grand tradition.
To commemorate that series of shows (which ran from October 28-31), the family released a massive box set that includes all six concerts on a USB stick, in 24-bit WAV audio for a flawless sound experience, PLUS a jaw-dropping adult size Frank Zappa costume in vintage 70s plastic style.</description>
