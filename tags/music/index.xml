      <description>Spotify Wrapped: 2020 Edition I thought this was worth highlighting from my listening statistics for this year.
No surprise there. I discovered her work in April and became a huge fan over the course of the year, as I mentioned once before.
But in the top 0.05% of listeners?
That surprised me a little.
I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go ahead and say that I am the NUMBER ONE Blossom Dearie fan on Spotify.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Recent events got me resurrecting an old feature of the site that I&amp;rsquo;ve neglected far too long. Today&amp;rsquo;s YouTube cover battle features Rage Against the Machine&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_in_the_Name&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Killing in the Name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Frank Zappa Halloween Costume</title>

      <description>I think I just found my Halloween costume for this year.
How did I ever miss this? It debuted just last year for the 40th anniversary celebration of Frank Zappa&amp;rsquo;s legendary Halloween concert series at The Palladium in New York. Zappa did Halloween concerts throughout the entirety of his career, but the one in 1977 is generally considered to be the apogee of that grand tradition.
To commemorate that series of shows (which ran from October 28-31), the family released a massive box set that includes all six concerts on a USB stick, in 24-bit WAV audio for a flawless sound experience, PLUS a jaw-dropping adult size Frank Zappa costume in vintage 70s plastic style.</description>
