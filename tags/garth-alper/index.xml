      <description>This is the guy that taught me and Kass to appreciate jazz, literally. He was our old jazz and music appreciation professor in college. On a couple of occasions we went to see him and his band play around town. Neat guy, and some people said we kind of resembled each other.
I always found this sound makes for good study music. This is his third album, I believe, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty strong.</description>
