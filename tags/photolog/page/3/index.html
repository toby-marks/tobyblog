  <p>
	
	  Already a great place to find exotic candies, foreign soda pop, and specialty food items at any time of the year (Brian Hammons, you know what I'm talking about), World Market really comes alive for Halloween. If you've got one in your area, get down there right now and check their selection. The stuff they carry is definitely outside of the Target/Big Lots/Dollar Store Halloween mold, but that's not to say it's super expensive.

	  Greetings, friends! It's been a few days since my last update, but I haven't been idle. Have you noticed how early the stores are stocking for Halloween this year? I blogged about my first sighting at At Home&nbsp;(formerly Garden Ridge)&nbsp;which was on July 1st, a full one month earlier than last year. (And if you're interested, that was at a chain called Home Goods, where the theme of ravens &amp; blackbirds predominated.

  <p>
	
	  Yesterday Yankee Candle had a special one-day preview of their upcoming Halloween 2014 collection, and we dropped in to get a look. Thanks to @PerkyJewels #FF for the tip-off!


Tragically, most of the "Bonies" decorations were sold out by the time we got there. We were told by staff that most of the merchandise was gone within the first half-hour of the store opening, so that should show you the amazing pent-up demand for Halloween this year.

	  I like geocaching for lots of reasons. I like to be outside. I like discovering new places. I like walking and connecting with nature. But occasionally I learn something as well. Usually it&rsquo;s just local historical trivia, or maybe a geography lesson. But sometimes the lesson is more personal, and as in this case, tragic.
The morning started out with a trip to the Trinity Trails in Wylie, Texas for some hiking and caching.

	  I have no particular fear of clowns. I am not one of those people. But this thing gives me the creeps. Downright turns my stomach.
I found it in an ammo can in a small copse of woods near the office, nestled among a collection of unremarkable trinkets. It&rsquo;s only about an inch or so high, so it took me a second to realize that it carries in its left hand a severed human arm.
