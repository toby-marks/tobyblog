	  #pic { display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; }   Do you remember Collector's Crypt? I wrote about that place around this time last year. It's closed now. I had a dream about it the other night, or rather its next incarnation, which was as a hybrid Christmas/Halloween store. I know the owners have an interest in Christmas things, so that detail is not too surprising. But in my dream, there was also a functional toilet over by the register.

<p><em>You have unlocked bonus content!</em></p>
<p>Welcome to this retroactively inserted yearly retrospective. The date I am writing this is actually December 30, 2020. If you&rsquo;ve found this page, that means you&rsquo;ve stumbled upon some content that, while genuinely old, was not originally posted on this date. Greetings from the future! Or something. I suppose I could make some joke right now warning you to &ldquo;turn back&rdquo; from the dread year 2020, but that whole bit seems tired and depressing.</p>
<p>Instead I will invite you to look at this gallery of my favorite photos from 2015; a year that included a fantastic visit from my buddy <a href="http://reviewtheworld.com/">Brian</a> from Ohio, a really glorious crop of firewheels (the likes of which we&rsquo;ve not seen since), and one of my greatest sets of Halloween carved pumpkins ever — a tribute to the Universal Monsters.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

	  While in attendance at Texas Frightmare Weekend I picked up a small pocket watch as a souvenir for my daughter from the booth of Diana Levin. Check out her gallery on her website. Or better yet, if you like what you see you can buy something from her Etsy store.

	  Being a fan of post-Christmas year end wrap-ups, I decided to create a Flickr set highlighting some of the events and activities that filled our lives this year. These are not my best photos or even my favorites, but just a (largish) collection of pictures that capture the essence of 2014 for me. A little bit of countryside, a little bit of life at home. One or two guest appearances. Flowers and ponies and monsters and toys.

	  Those of you paying close attention&nbsp;will remember that Tobyblog owes its existence to my good buddy Brian Hammons of the nostalgia blog&nbsp;reviewtheworld.com. His site is a surprisingly deep personal catalog that is as much a call to action and personal philosophical movement as anything. Brian has been at this game for far longer than YouTube has been around, and has amassed an unparalleled amount of footage and articles documenting the greater part of his life, from high school hijinks to romances come and gone, to thirty-something introspections with friends.
