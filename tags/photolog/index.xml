      <description>This year was different.
News of the virus in China had already begun to circulate late last year. The videos and stories coming out of Wuhan were quite terrifying. People being welded into their apartments to prevent them from leaving. Bodies being secretly cremated en masse by the authorities. Sick people being burned alive. You have to wonder now if any of that had any basis in reality. I have come to distrust the news, both mainstream and alternative.</description>

      <description>You have unlocked bonus content!
Welcome to this retroactively inserted yearly retrospective. The date I am writing this is actually December 30, 2020. If you&amp;rsquo;ve found this page, that means you&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon some content that, while genuinely old, was not originally posted on this date. Greetings from the future! Or something. I suppose I could make some joke right now warning you to &amp;ldquo;turn back&amp;rdquo; from the dread year 2020, but that whole bit seems tired and depressing.</description>

      <title>Smells Like Halloween at Yankee Candle</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in a smell? The power to evoke. Memories. People. Places. And special times in our lives. Seasons long forgotten. All brought back in an instant the second a particular aroma hits our nostrils. It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder that scented candles, long thought domain of grandmas and boring little gift shops, have become respected among the nostalgia set in recent years. I read once that people don&amp;rsquo;t remember scents; that you remember the things associated with it or the strong feelings the scent creates, but the brain does not store memory of the scent itself. And now I find myself trying to remember what the woods smell like in autumn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
