      <description>While I&amp;rsquo;m at it I might as well post this, too, since Josh got such a kick out of it. I sent this to him a week or so ago, then days later he&amp;rsquo;s in the hospital. Great timing on my part. Maybe he didn&amp;rsquo;t follow soon enough the sober and thoughtful advice given in this video.
Get well, my brother.</description>

      <description>Just got this from my brother, who at this moment is being hospitalized in Louisiana for pneumonia and possible coronavirus infection. Still awaiting results of his 2nd test. Hasn&amp;rsquo;t killed his sense of humor. We love you, Josh. Get well.</description>
