	  Are you looking for something spooky to watch as we wind our way down to Halloween, but find yourself bored by the usual fare of cheesy monster movies or gross slasher flicks? Maybe you&rsquo;re in the mood for something a little more thoughtful; a little more substantial, perhaps? Let me show you something interesting.
 Apparitions&nbsp;is a BBC miniseries about a Catholic exorcist who finds himself at the center of a satanic intrigue that reaches to the Vatican and threatens the world itself.

  <p>
	
	  The Decorator&rsquo;s Warehouse, located in Arlington, Texas, bills itself as Texas&rsquo;s largest Christmas store. And it is very large. But what really impresses you upon entering the place is just how jam-packed it is with holiday and seasonal baubles, as if despite its football-field size floor space they still did not have quite enough room to fit everything.&nbsp;
As soon as you walk in the door you&rsquo;re assaulted with holiday cheer; the entrance is rather elaborately decorated and serves as both a picture station and portal of sorts into this alternate dimension that feels something like Santa&rsquo;s attic.

  <p>
    
      The Super Mega Fun Pack geocache (GC5Z4X7) is a thinly-veiled tribute to Matt of dinosaurdracula.com and the amazing box of goodies that he puts together every month for his hordes of devoted fans. It&rsquo;s only &ldquo;veiled&rdquo; at all because of the (understandable) policy of geocaching.com not to list any cache with references to commercial products. After going back and forth with them a bit about this, I relented and removed any overt references to Matt or his website, including changing the name of the cache from the original &ldquo;The Dino Drac Fun Pack Geocache&rdquo; to &ldquo;Super Mega Fun Pack&rdquo;.

  <p>
	
	  We&rsquo;re just under 100 days to Halloween now, but there are certain places you can always depend on to roll out the spooky stock a little early. I covered At Home last year and this year&rsquo;s selection looks bigger and better than ever. For 2015 our local store has literally doubled the floor space devoted to Halloween goods. And, well, just take a look for yourself.

	  While in attendance at Texas Frightmare Weekend I picked up a small pocket watch as a souvenir for my daughter from the booth of Diana Levin. Check out her gallery on her website. Or better yet, if you like what you see you can buy something from her Etsy store.
