      Back in the summer of 2013 TheVCubeSolver and I dropped by the local candy shop to review Blue Bunny&rsquo;s Jolly Rancher Cool Tubes, a push-pop like product in three weird flavors. It turned out to be a complete and total sensory experience.

	  <p>Since Brian and Review the World were my main inspirations in starting my own blog, I figured it would be fitting to begin by introducing some of my favorite episodes from the past year. According to Brian, 2013 was one of the busiest years he&rsquo;s ever had on the site, and it shows. He had a ton of great content.</p>
<h3 id="10-the-brian-and-tim-show-episode-25-halloween-extra---ufo-and-ghost-discussionhttpwwwreviewtheworldcom201310b-show-25-ufo-ghost-discussionhtmlm0"><a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2013/10/b-show-25-ufo-ghost-discussion.html?m=0">#10: The Brian and Tim Show Episode #25: Halloween Extra - UFO and Ghost Discussion</a></h3>
<p>Sort of an extended special segment of the 2013 Halloween episode, Brian and Tim decide to talk about their own experiences with the paranormal. Basically this was how my cousins and I spent many a late night when I was younger, and I&rsquo;m sure by the end of this you&rsquo;ll be talking to your screen wanting to add your two cents. Who knows? Maybe some of mine will get featured on this blog one day.</p>

	  <p>My name is Toby.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2013 I discovered Brian Hammons' blog <a href="http://reviewtheworldblog.blogspot.com/">Review the World</a>, and something inside clicked. Here was a guy — just slightly my junior — getting out and enjoying life with his friends, exploring his local environment, and generally on fire with all the possibilities that an ordinary life offers to those who know how to look for them. I had spent the bulk of 2012 doing all of those things with my two older kids while my wife was, for the most part (and regrettably), stuck at home working and/or gestating. It was a magic year open to all sorts of new experiences. That all ended, or seemed to, with the arrival of the new baby and all of the familiar responsibilities that went along with being a third-time father. Brian&rsquo;s videos, especially the <a href="http://reviewtheworldblog.blogspot.com/search/label/Go%20Road%20Trip">GO! Road Trip</a> series, seemed to crystalize that sense of adventure and exploration I was missing at that moment, and which I sorely missed enjoying with the kids, at least as frequently as we had grown accustomed to over the preceding year. I contacted Brian to tell him how much I liked his videos, and to encourage him to make more. And now, almost a year later, he is encouraging me to join him in this little online party.</p>
<p><em>Challenge accepted.</em></p>
<p>My intent for this site is somewhat different than Brian&rsquo;s for Review the World; that being said, I refuse to allow myself to constrain its potentialities. The site will grow organically, entertaining this or that whim or obsession, observing the seasons and responding to events. But a few core ideas will no doubt shape and permeate its essence for its natural life span, and those do not bear mentioning now, as they will become obvious soon enough.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
