	  <p>A cappuccino is a wonderful way to start the morning. Though this morning I can say Iâ€™ve had better. There was a guy here who had one of those ironic mustaches. He could make good coffee. I wonder where he went. And if he still has that mustache. And if he left, maybe, to startup some better place that specializes in morning cappuccinos? And where that place might be, and if they have WiFi?</p>

<p>Good morning. ðŸŒž</p>

    <p>The soul has to make a choice, and the outcome will either break it into pieces or enable it to sail to its destination in God. And the choice comes down to this: Will the soul accept or reject suffering? Will it make this suffering its own, or struggle against it, seeing it as something alien to itself?</p>

<p>&hellip;If he chooses to accept his suffering, he must embrace it with the wholeness of his life; he must discover and accept the proper relation to his suffering. If he can do this, he will have transformed his suffering so that in the end his only reality will be God. But if he continues to resist his suffering, refusing to find his salvation in it, his anguish will continue unabated.</p>

<p>The question is ultimately this: Will he offer himself as a voluntary sacrifice to the will of God? &hellip;He must accept as his own will, as his own desire, the will of God for his life. If this happens, he will cease being anxious about his sufferings, for he will see that they too are the signs and tokens of God&rsquo;s presence.</p>

<p>~Archimandrite Aimilianos, Psalms and the Life of Faith, p. 100-102.</p>
