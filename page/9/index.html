	  <p>If you haven&rsquo;t been following Kassi over on her personal blog, by all means go there and check it out. She&rsquo;s been killing it lately, posting about all the family stuff I&rsquo;m supposed to be getting to over on this site, but have been too lame to do. I swear she can fire off 3 or 4 posts by the time I&rsquo;m done editing the same number of photos. Practice, I guess? Her latest one about the John Muir books she&rsquo;s been collecting has put me in a very vacation-y kind of mood. I thought it was funny that she called me out for still working on photos from two years ago, which is true. But I have learned (what I think is) a whole lot in the meantime, and my camera and software suite, and hopefully my editing sensibilities, have evolved a great deal in that time. It&rsquo;s been fun revisiting those not-so-old photos and reminiscing on the times we spent out on the road in some very rugged country. I&rsquo;d honestly forgotten just how pretty it was up in Colorado the summer of 2017. Anyway, enjoy the blog and hopefully get inspired yourself. John Muir was a great man, one of this nation&rsquo;s finest. And more to come here on all that as well.</p>

    <p>One wonders how one gets to be a known walker. Do you introduce yourself? Do you have to register at the office? Are there name tags?</p>

<p>In any event, I would love to get my hands on that (presumably massive) unknown mall walker dossier down at the precinct. Must be how they break in the rookie detectives.</p>

<p>There’s no denying we live in troubled times in this country. Shared celebrations are a respite from the hate that seems set to smother our culture. They also serve as milestones, reminding us of the passage of time and providing a useful historical perspective on our own lives and the times we share with each other. For our part, we plan to celebrate like we haven’t in a while, venturing down to the mall later for the big party, then fireworks later tonight. Before that I’ll be grilling pizzas in the backyard, and I hope to get a lot of today on camera.</p>
