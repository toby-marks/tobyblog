    <p>Good morning ðŸŒž</p>

<p>&hellip;and good Monday! Summer really feels like it&rsquo;s slipping away this morning, though it&rsquo;s not particularly cool or fallish here in North Texas. Something about the light has changed, as my <a href="https://kassiblogtoo.blogspot.com">Kassi</a> likes to point out. In any event, fall&rsquo;s been on my mind lately. Last year was a complete bust, mostly rained out and washed away. I have hope for a better season this year, with more appreciation for the little graces, and far more time outdoors.</p>

<p>This morning I&rsquo;m rediscovering an old hangout, a local coffee shop, and remembering why I used to like to come here so much. I had to give it up for a time as a morning work location due to the noise level getting completely out of hand, not to mention the obnoxious and blaring music choices that sadly became the norm, presumably in an effort, as unsuccessful as it was, to drive away all the obnoxious and blaring patrons. This morning we&rsquo;ve returned to a smaller (though still respectable, and much more subdued) crowd, with soft jazz played at a merciful volume.</p>

<p>And the cappuccino is as excellent as always.</p>

    <p>I guess the travel log sort of fizzled out, but I&rsquo;ll be throwing up vacation pics <em>real soon now</em>. We had a wonderful time, but to be honest we&rsquo;re reconsidering how we plan our future vacations to have a slower pace, and be focused more on one or two areas. Coming home was unusually hard, what with having to deal with Frank on top of the normal hustle of unpacking and washing everything, and also taking care of some minor car damage sustained during the trip. We&rsquo;re lucky it wasn&rsquo;t a whole lot worse, as we managed to get caught in a hail storm at Red Rock, only minutes after this photo was taken.</p>

	  <p>I always considered those things the grossest of the gross. But did get me thinking about alternative &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; materials. A gel toilet seat? Cushion of air? Water? Yeah, like a water bed â€” but instead it&rsquo;s a toilet seat.</p>
