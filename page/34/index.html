	  Yesterday I took the kids to the amazing Retropalooza convention in Arlington, Texas, and boy did we have a blast! There were loads and loads of dealer tables with some very cool nostalgia items on display, classic and rare games galore, cosplayers, and even a few YouTube celebrities. Take a look at some of the fun things we discovered.
The owner of Tendril here was willing to let him go for a meagre forty dollars, making it the best deal I found.

	  September has arrived, and it&rsquo;s time to open another funpack from Dinosaur Dracula!

Most of you may already recognize Dinosaur Dracula as the preeminent nostalgia blog on the web. (If not, you may recall its previous incarnation, X-Entertainment) Matt, the guy that runs the site, puts on quite a show every year for the Halloween season, and I must say 2014 is already off to a great start! Watching his videos and reading his reviews has become sort of a Halloween tradition in our family, something we look forward to every year.

      My buddy Brian Hammons over at Review the World requested another video food review, so I though I&rsquo;d introduce him to a down-home treat from my childhood. I hope you&rsquo;re happy with the results. I&rsquo;m not gonna lie, this one is a bit of a deep dive; a little something for my hardcore devotees. That is, people that like watching me eat stuff in my car. And yes, I manage to add yet another stain to my car seat.
