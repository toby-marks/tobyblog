	  (Works best if you read this in an Andy Rooney-esque whine.)

This keeps happening to me over and over and over again lately. I have to make use of the public facilities (seldom a delightful experience anyway), I go to the sink, wash my hands, look up, and see this mess —


Now what is wrong with this picture? Take a look at how this works.

	  I woke up this morning with this song stuck in my head, thinking about my dad and the good progress he&rsquo;s making recovering from a triple bypass operation.
I probably thought of it because I noticed it was in the repertoire of local musician Bruce Wilder, who graced us at the coffee shop one evening with his guitar.
  Here are my three favorite YouTube covers of this 1966 song by Paul Simon and Bruce Woodley.

	  New Orleans is, of course, a city known for its food, home to some of the best chefs in the country. I was in town recently, so I figured I&rsquo;d check out some of the local establishments and give you guys a virtual sight-tasting tour. Let&rsquo;s start with the hotel vending machine.


Hey, I hadn&rsquo;t eaten all day and I had a couple of hours to kill till my family showed up.

	  Love this song. Local musician Bruce Wilder was recently performing it solo at Firewheel Coffee, my office away from the office. Makes me want to sneak up behind him with a giant saxophone and start blaring away at the appropriate moments.
