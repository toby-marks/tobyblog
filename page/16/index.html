      Those of you paying close attention&nbsp;will remember that Tobyblog owes its existence to my good buddy Brian Hammons of the nostalgia blog&nbsp;reviewtheworld.com. His site is a surprisingly deep personal catalog that is as much a call to action and personal philosophical movement as anything. Brian has been at this game for far longer than YouTube has been around, and has amassed an unparalleled amount of footage and articles documenting the greater part of his life, from high school hijinks to romances come and gone, to thirty-something introspections with friends.

      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Red Death&rsquo; had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal — the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution.&rdquo;&ldquo;With such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take care of itself.&rdquo;&ldquo;All these and security were within.

      I love Halloween. You do, too. This video is a tribute to that season, to every memory and every thrill. To cold autumn nights. To the warm glow of jack o&rsquo; lanterns. To spooky stories and cozy evenings. To every bit of magic and adventure in our lives. This is the story of Halloween 2013 as we experienced it; what has gone down in our lives and memories as THE BEST HALLOWEEN EVER.

  <p>
    
      Already a great place to find exotic candies, foreign soda pop, and specialty food items at any time of the year (Brian Hammons, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about), World Market really comes alive for Halloween. If you&rsquo;ve got one in your area, get down there right now and check their selection. The stuff they carry is definitely outside of the Target/Big Lots/Dollar Store Halloween mold, but that&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s super expensive.

      Yesterday I took the kids to the amazing Retropalooza convention in Arlington, Texas, and boy did we have a blast! There were loads and loads of dealer tables with some very cool nostalgia items on display, classic and rare games galore, cosplayers, and even a few YouTube celebrities. Take a look at some of the fun things we discovered.
The owner of Tendril here was willing to let him go for a meagre forty dollars, making it the best deal I found.

      Here you go, folks, the real star of Phantasm — that bad-ass muscle car! A real thing of beauty, and I&rsquo;m not even that much of a car guy.
