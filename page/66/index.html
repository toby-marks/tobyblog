	  <p>Today is Ash Wednesday, the Catholic holy day that begins the penitential season of Lent. This year I will not be celebrating as a Catholic.</p>
<p>Last year on September 1st Kassi and I, after a long season of spiritual apathy and suffering, took our first steps into the Russian Orthodox Church. There were private reasons, of course. Personal reasons that are always at the core of any conversion; but also open reasons. We did not take the step lightly.</p>

	  <p>I&rsquo;ve had this song stuck in my head for a couple of days, and maybe if I post it I can get rid of it. It&rsquo;s from The Jerk, and features Bernadette Peters, my first screen crush when I was just a little kid. That bit at the end where she pulls out the coronet still cracks me up. Still, it&rsquo;s a touching scene, don&rsquo;t you think? A little reminder that life can be sweet sometimes.</p>

	  <p>Infexxion is an iPhone game based on the old arcade game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxx">Attax</a>. My cousin Carl introduced me to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-CTpCD-CNc">it</a>. There was a cabinet in the lobby of a (surely long-since demolished?) movie theater in what is now a rough part of Lafayette, Louisiana. I forget what we were seeing that night. He played ‚Äî I didn&rsquo;t, as I recall. It had a weird, edgy kind of quality to it, like an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giobpyH6FnY">Exidy game</a>. It&rsquo;s addictive. The only place I&rsquo;ve seen it since is <a href="http://freeplayrichardson.com/">Freeplay Arcade</a> in Richardson, Texas, where if you can beat the final &ldquo;boss&rdquo; AI, you get a free beer.</p>
<p><em>One</em> time, just a few weeks after discovering Infexxion, I scored a 40. I&rsquo;ve been playing that game for over a year now. In all that time, I have never matched or beaten that score.</p>
<p>Not a single time.</p>

<p>My love, she weeps at many things,<br>
I would not for the world stop up her tears;<br>
She came in many years of drought<br>
And taught me just how right was private rain<br>
To touch the dust with smallest storm <br>
With emerald droppings from her eyes.<br></p>
<p>My loved one weeps at many things,<br>
Small rings and charms, the soft alarms of birds,<br>
Or sudden summer squall. Large thing or small:<br>
The way the cat puts up his bones in fur,<br>
Teakettle purrs and murmurs:<br>
Slumber. Sleep. October. Autumn. Fall.<br>
Sometimes I say a thing and do not know I say a Joy<br>
Then hear a sound and turn and there she goes full-weep.<br>
Pours forth the diamonds, lets out a cry<br>
As from a thousand hours of happy nightmare/sleep.<br></p>
<p>In all the splendid time ahead, those years<br>
With yet their secret joys unsaid,<br>
Let no one stay her tears.<br>
Praise God for them and her, praise God for eyes<br>
That smallness see, and grow it to a size,<br>
That see in me a fellow weeper found<br>
And celebrate by laying dust<br>
On our small ceremonial trysting ground.<br>
Then am I rich?<br>
Look here‚Ä¶ I wear with grace<br>
The gifts of rain and light and love and time<br>
She&rsquo;s made and winked and left<br>
To brighten my soul&rsquo;s face.<br></p>

    <p>I made a couple of site updates yesterday I wanted to mention.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now, if you click on the logo image, you&rsquo;ll be taken back to the home page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I fixed the stylesheets for mobile devices so that the photoblog image previews work a little better and appear more consistent between small screen and large screen devices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to click on the title of a photoblog (like the recent <a href="https://tobyblog.com/photos/20190226-lax-international-terminal/">Scenes from the LAX International Terminal</a>) to see the full set of photos. You can click on the <a href="https://tobyblog.com/photos/">Photos</a> link at the top of the site to see all my photoblogs.</p>
<p>The site actually looks great on mobile. I think I prefer it that way. Enjoy!</p>
