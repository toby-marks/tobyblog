      Come along with the kids and I on our first night caching adventure. For the uninitiated among you, night caching is simply geocaching at night. Generally night caches are made so that you can&rsquo;t find them during the daytime, by making use of trails of reflective tacks or tape or other forms of guidance visible only at night.

	  One thing I love is end of year retrospectives. And in the grand tradition I started last year, I offer to you the top ten Review the World episodes of 2014. So clear your personal calendars, grab a bag of Rap Snacks, and settle in the for the show. These are all episodes I love, and I encourage you to watch every one in its entirety.
#10: Childhood Neighborhood Tour We begin with Brian&rsquo;s most recent entry, one that was intended to cap all of his furious activity for 2014, and at one point, possibly forever.

<p>We have reached &ldquo;Peak Blogger&rdquo; in this society, folks. If the existence of Tobyblog was not proof of that already, take a look at the above picture. It was a cold, blustery Saturday afternoon and I was visiting nearby Arlington. It was around lunchtime and I had some time to kill, so I decided to walk over to the nearby strip mall and scope out the restaurants. There were a surprising number of cuisines on offer for such a small area, but this place caught my eye. <a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/">Brian Hammons</a> had mentioned to me recently how his buddy Nick Van Bever is a fan of chicken strips and fries. I figured I&rsquo;d do some recon for Nick, in case he ever makes his way down to Dallas.</p>

<p>Those of you paying <a href="https://tobyblog.com/posts/20140202-the-beginning/">close attention</a> will remember that Tobyblog owes its existence to my good buddy Brian Hammons of the nostalgia blog <a href="http://reviewtheworld.com/">reviewtheworld.com</a>. His site is a surprisingly deep personal catalog that is as much a call to action and personal philosophical movement as anything.</p>
