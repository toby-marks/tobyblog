and this is <span style="font-style:italic;">Tobyblog</span> â€” my personal, well, blog. I write about things that interest me, but mostly about <span style="font-weight:bold;">Halloween</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">geocaching</span>, and special places that I love. I recommend <a href="/posts">taking a look at my back catalog</a>. Have fun poking around.
