Love this song. Local musician Bruce Wilder was recently performing it solo at Firewheel Coffee, my office away from the office. Makes me want to sneak up behind him with a giant saxophone and start blaring away at the appropriate moments.  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3HMH3jsDfT0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
