<p>This is a tribute video to my brother. You can think of it as the pilot episode of a fictional reality show series. It includes some backyard wrestling, a special cooking segment also featured in the <a href="http://www.tobyblog.com/2015/11/the-tobyblog-thanksgiving-special.html">2015 Thanksgiving Special</a>, and a frog tossing competition using actual Louisiana bull frogs. It is wild, and like the man himself, not quite safe for work!</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7xtj-sTj26g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
