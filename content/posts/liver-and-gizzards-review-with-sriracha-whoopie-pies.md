My buddy Brian Hammons over at <a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/">Review the World</a> requested another video food review, so I though I'd introduce him to a down-home treat from my childhood. I hope you're happy with the results. I'm not gonna lie, this one is a bit of a deep dive; a little something for my hardcore devotees. That is, people that like watching me eat stuff in my car. And yes, I manage to add yet another stain to my car seat. For you, people, for you.<br /><br />While you're at it, why don't you check out some of my other food reviews?<br /><br /><ul><li>There's that time I went to <a href="http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/02/zyka-indian-food-review.html">Zyka Indian Restaurant</a></li><li>The V-Cube Solver's <a href="http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/02/jolly-rancher-cool-tubes-review.html">Jolly Rancher Cool Tubes</a> review</li><li>My famous <a href="http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/02/taco-naan-review.html">Taco Naan</a> review</li><li>The Buddy Team's epic <a href="http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/04/thevcubesolver-and-i-review-takis-cane.html">Taki's/Cane Sugar Soda</a> review</li><li>The V-Cube Solver tackles <a href="http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/04/kryptonite-kandy.html">Kryptonite Kandy</a></li><li>A <a href="http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/05/toe-2-toe-review-chili-cheese-fries.html">Chili Cheese Fries</a> throw down</li><li>A tribute to my wife's special&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/06/anniversary-candy.html">Anniversary Candy</a></li><li>My magic review of some <a href="http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/07/new-orleans-food-review.html">food I found in New Orleans</a> (I won't say where)</li></ul><div>Enjoy.</div><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/XHGe3D4sJAc" width="640"></iframe>
