The interesting things you run across when you decide to walk the mile and a half back to the hotel instead of Uber-ing. This is an old Methodist Church in the Playhouse District of Pasadena. Almost looks like an entrance to another world. A secret garden. A little foreboding perhaps. 

There was a lot about this area I’d like to explore. I’ll be back again.
