Is this the most chill song in the world? 

> In fact, listening to that one song — “Weightless” — resulted in a striking 65 percent reduction in participants’ overall anxiety, and a 35 percent reduction in their usual physiological resting rates.

I have a lot of tracks I listen to alter or set my mood, but I've never seen the phenomenon quantified so neatly. I'd like to see the measurable improvements in focus, attention, or creativity that music is capable of producing. Not to mention physical effects — improved strength, speed, and stamina. The immune system. Can music heal? Why do we respond to music? 

The answer lies somewhere, I think, somewhere outside of human psychology or physiology. 

Anyway, calm down and listen to this. Or vice versa.
