<p>After a long hiatus, my front seat food review series is back! This time I feature some of the Waco area's finest gas station Czech cuisine. If you're ever in the area you should absolutely stop at one or both of these fine establishments. Such a treat.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5SaRwsUdFGI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
