Joined once again by nostalgia blogger and good friend Brian Hammons of [reviewtheworld.com](http://www.reviewtheworld.com/), Augie and I team up to complete our trilogy of Skittles reviews, this time looking at the legendary and rarely sighted Cauldron Skittles variety, now in its second year on store shelves. Does the candy itself live up to the promise of its bright orange bag? We find out, and the answer may just *shock* you. (It probably won't.)

Enjoy the video, and here's hoping we see more of Brian in the near future!
