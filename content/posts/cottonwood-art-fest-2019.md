Somewhere around the beginning of May (and again in the fall) the city of Richardson, Texas invites artists from across the country to gather in Cottonwood Park for a big market day celebration of beauty and imagination. [The Cottonwood Art Festival](https://www.cottonwoodartfestival.com) features some brilliant and rigorously curated talent, and is described by the artists themselves as one of the best art shows in the country. This year we decided to pay a visit as a family. And although the younger two would crap out early from the mild heat and post-rainy day humidity, we did manage to hang around just long enough for me to discover my new favorite artist, Alla Tsank.

More on her later.

For anyone in the area who's actually thinking of attending one of these shows, know that parking can be a nightmare, especially if you show up midday, like we did. We lucked upon a spot not too far from the park, but far enough that my younger kids were already whinging by the time we got to the gates. The show is free to attend, which is good, because we weren't able to stay very long. ðŸ™„

The heavy rain in days prior added some mugginess to the spring heat, and the ground was fairly wet. To compensate for that the festival organizers had laid down a thick layer of hay, which soaked up the mud and kept your shoes clean. In addition to artists and craftsmen of all types, there was a wide assortment of food and drink available, and even live music.
