I could hardly let the 8th anniversary of Ray Bradbury's death pass without a notice. But I also don't have a lot of time at the moment, so I thought I'd commemorate by posting this video of an Indian guy giving a lesson on Bradbury's short story All Summer in a Day, in Hindi, from what looks like an underground bunker.

Enjoy!
