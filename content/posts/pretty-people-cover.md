Currently enjoying this sweet cover of one of my favorite Blossom Dearie tracks. That's [not the only Blossom Dearie song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipeztjJjQm4) they cover, too. Apparently somebody over there is a fan.

If there were more covers of her music I'd love to do another cover battle, but alas. Blossom is too much underappreciated.
