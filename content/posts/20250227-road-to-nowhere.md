Currently serving as my official on-the-go and anytime music playlist, the fourth entry in my Dad Wagon series serves up the usual chill sounds with an iconoclastic and occasionally discordant flare. **Beware.** This is not your ordinary boomer playlist. Expect to be surprised, delighted, and sometimes disappointed when my curated selections strain the limits of what can popularly be considered acceptable listening. 

Enjoy.

I've included embeds here for the mother playlist on Spotify, which is usually the first to get updated, as well as the mirror over on Apple Music. The only thing is that the embeds only preview the songs, you can't listen to the whole thing. But feel free to like/favorite/add if you dig the sonic vibes. The links to do so are in the embeds.

The Dad Wagon playlists have evolved over the years, and by now you're getting (for the most part) some pretty deep cuts. 

This playlist at the moment represents *my personal sound.* The sound of **Tobyblog**. The sound of my soul. It has been known to inspire a tear or two. So ponder that. And if I can add a word of advice, give it some time. Listen to it out of order. As with all the Dad Wagon family, it takes a while to find its natural character.

You can listen to all the songs in full in the YouTube playlist. Frankly, the audio quality there is as good as you'll find. If you do decide to give it a plunge, how does it make you feel?
