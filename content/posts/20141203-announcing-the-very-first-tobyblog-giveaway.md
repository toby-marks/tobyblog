Would you like to win this original 8 x 10 photograph that hung in our house this past Halloween? 

<!--more-->

It's a photo inspired by my all-time favorite Halloween blog, [The Skull and Pumpkin.](http://theskullpumpkin.blogspot.com/) The updates have been spotty over these past few years, but the back content is well worth discovering for yourself. If you do take a look, be sure to leave a comment in appreciation. He still reads those.

To win the photo, see if you can guess my first iTunes Music Store purchase.

Was itâ€¦

1. Dreams, by The Cranberries
2. Heart and Soul, by Huey Lewis & The News
3. It Was a Good Day, by Ice Cube
4. Wichita Lineman, by Glen Campbell
5. Steppin Out, by Joe Jackson
6. Never, Never Gonna Give You Up, by Barry White
7. Time, by Boy George
8. Hummingbird, by Seals & Crofts
9. Future Song (Love a Good Woman, Love a Good Man), by Curtis Mayfield
10. Knockin' On Heaven's Door, by Eric Clapton

Think you know? Leave a comment. You get one guess only. The first to guess correctly wins. I'll even autograph it if you want. 

Good luck!
