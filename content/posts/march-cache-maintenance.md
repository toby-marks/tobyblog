The log for <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC56HRR_review-the-world-series-3?guid=84f80389-4cc8-44a0-8537-6759a73790c9">RtW #3</a> had filled up and Augie's <a href="http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC55KHP_the-lost-little-beaver">beaver cache</a> had recently been reported missing. A little town, a little country. More geocaching goodness for you.
