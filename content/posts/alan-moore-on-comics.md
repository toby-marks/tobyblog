The culture is dumbing down, becoming more juvenile, and this is just one manifestation of that. 

I like his interpretation of heroes as "cowardice compensators". He seemed to be making a specific reference to conditions in the comic publishing business, but I wonder if it's true in a larger sense, for the people who create comics and for the broader culture. I'd like to see more of that kind of psycho-social analysis.
