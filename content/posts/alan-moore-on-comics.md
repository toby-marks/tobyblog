I've made the same remark before. Not so much that it's weird to see individual people my age obsessing over Star Wars or comic book movies or Lord of the Rings — people after all are going to have their own quirky passions — but that it's weird to see the entire adult culture obsessing over such things, which after all were for nerds. I lived through all that in its proper context during adolescence, and something feels wrong (and frankly a little boring) about a world that's stuck on all this stuff you moved on from 20 years ago. The storylines aren't even modern; it's all material ripped from the 80s and 90s.
