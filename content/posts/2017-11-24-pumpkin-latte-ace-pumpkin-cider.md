This year while out shopping for turkey and wine, I discovered a couple of very fallish, and very Thanksgiving-appropriate beverages I thought I'd share with you all. One is a new seasonal coffee brew from my favorite DFW brewery [Martin House](http://martinhousebrewing.com/), and the other is a special cider I haven't seen in three years — [Ace's]({{< ref "/posts/ace-pineapple-cider--shannon-irish-red.md" >}}) own extraordinary Pumpkin Cider. Read on!

Martin House won me over years ago with their amazing [Pretzel Stout](http://martinhousebrewing.com/the-beer/pretzel-stout/) beer and [River House](http://martinhousebrewing.com/the-beer/river-house/) saisonal ale. Very distinctive on their own, together they drew my attention to this Fort Worth brewer, and I've since tried several others of their generally outstanding beers, but I won't lie about something else that really draws me to them.

_Just look at that can art._

Although they can be a bit hit-and-miss across the board, Martin House has some of the coolest can art I've ever seen. I generally drink my beer from a glass, but when I had the Pretzel Stout I'd always keep the can close by, and the River House I always wanted to drink directly *from the can*. It just felt right. 

You'd better believe I'll be on the lookout for the Acheron, which [according to the website](http://martinhousebrewing.com/the-beer/acheron/) is set to become available again in January.

Being a big fan of Martin House, pumpkin pie, coffee, beer, and Thanksgiving I was very much looking forward to trying this beer, and I can tell you — it didn't disappoint.

If you've never had a coffee beer, it might be hard to describe the taste, but the bitter tones you'd expect are definitely there and noticeable. I suppose it's something you either like or hate, and I'm in the former camp. I can't say it's good for all the time, but it just might make A.M. ale a thing for you. T
