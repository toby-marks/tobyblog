You would think that in this "woke" era the comedies of Norman Lear would be better appreciated, but I don't think his many efforts to reboot his old series are going anywhere. Not because of any politically touchy subject matter, but because he saw the humanity in all of his characters, including those like Archie Bunker who he used to illustrate everything he saw as wrong with modern American attitudes, but whom he based on his own beloved father. Modern folks aren't interested in any of that. They don't want subtleties, they certainly don't want to be challenged. They only want to condemn.

This one-night revival ought to be a fine tribute with some great casting. I think Woody Harrelson is a pretty perfect pick for Archie, and Marissa Tomei as Edith will be something to watch. Wanda Sykes would have made a natural Florence, though; I wouldn't have cast her as Weezy. I think Sherman Hemsley's George Jefferson is even more iconic than Archie Bunker, and it's going to be tough to do his portrayal justice.

As a Norman Lear fan I'll want to see this, and I'll certainly be wearing my "Shut Up Honkey" t-shirt.
