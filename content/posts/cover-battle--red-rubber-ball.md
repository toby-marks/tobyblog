I woke up this morning with this song stuck in my head, thinking about my dad and the good progress he's making recovering from a triple bypass operation.

I probably thought of it because I noticed it was in the repertoire of local musician Bruce Wilder, who graced us at the coffee shop one evening with his guitar.
