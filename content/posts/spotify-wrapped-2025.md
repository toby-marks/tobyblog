It is what it is, I guess.
<!--more--> 
I prefer to think of my musical tastes as "timeless", but to Spotify I'm a straight-up Boomer, no questions about it.

Look, I'll admit I've listened to a lot of Sixties music this year, mostly because of two things: this one solid playlist that I put together that I kind of grooved to for a while... 

{{< spotify type="playlist" id="1MQg6F2qMR1GGw1SIvYend?si=d22ff55ab0084d19" >}}

And a book I listened to on Audible by the legendary conspiracy author David McGowan, [Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon](https://www.audible.com/pd/Weird-Scenes-Inside-the-Canyon-Audiobook/B074WD8V1G?source_code=ASSGB149080119000H&share_location=pdp). Definitely one I would recommend, and worth checking out if you're interested in the darker side of California hippie culture.

So let's get into it.

Total listening time is way down from previous years, but I'm ok with that. I also split my time between Spotify and Apple Music more this year.

Respectable numbers. I'm always on the lookout for good new stuff. I especially like it when I stumble on whole new genres I can really dig into, but I feel like this year I mostly just revisited older themes.

Yep, pretty standard for me except for number 5, which I owe to Lucy getting me into Magdalena Bay.

They're on tour currently and Lucy and I went to see them at the House of Blues in Dallas in early October. It was a fantastic concert, and we respectively listened to the hell out of that album in the weeks leading up to it. I think Lucy registered in the top 0.5% of fans by listening time.

Not too surprising here, and pretty accurate given the amount of time I've sunk into my "Years" playlists — a little music discovery game I started with Carl but am now continuing on my own after he dipped due to lack of interest and Spotify being gay or something.

I kind of felt my #1 song was a little bit of cheat because although I dig it, it happened to be at the top of my 1965 playlist, which I felt gave it a bit of an artificial push in terms of direct listens.
