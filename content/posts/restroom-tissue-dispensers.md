(Works best if you read this in an Andy Rooney-esque whine.)<br /><div><br /></div><div>This keeps happening to me over and over and over again lately. I have to make use of the public facilities (seldom a delightful experience anyway), I go to the sink, wash my hands, look up, and see this mess â€”<br /><div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-54e0eSjh9S8/U9FwlwwqJqI/AAAAAAAAAkA/WBmtk8iqmGc/s640/blogger-image--541685519.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-54e0eSjh9S8/U9FwlwwqJqI/AAAAAAAAAkA/WBmtk8iqmGc/s640/blogger-image--541685519.jpg" /></a></div><a name='more'></a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div>Now what is wrong with this picture? Take a look at how this works.</div><div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JCOUiFmIvJk/U9Fw4TbxbOI/AAAAAAAAAkQ/NDn5bZH8FqQ/s640/blogger-image--1827737721.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JCOUiFmIvJk/U9Fw4TbxbOI/AAAAAAAAAkQ/NDn5bZH8FqQ/s640/blogger-image--1827737721.jpg" /></a></div><br /></div><div>You're supposed to pull the sheets from the bottom, and the angular momentum of your pull dispenses the next sheet. But what if there's no sheet? Huh? What then?!</div><div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zkDqWVsBa4I/U9Fw7G1hklI/AAAAAAAAAkY/CzPWP4RKGI8/s640/blogger-image-1156149362.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zkDqWVsBa4I/U9Fw7G1hklI/AAAAAAAAAkY/CzPWP4RKGI8/s640/blogger-image-1156149362.jpg" /></a></div><br /></div><div>There's clearly paper in there, but somebody ripped the damn thing off right at the source! And on models like these, there is no lever to force a tissue feed. You know how hard it is to coax that sheet out given the few millimeters of purchase visible in the above pic?&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Nigh impossible.</div><div><br /></div><div>But yet, somehow I'ved managed it. Every. Single. Time.</div><div><br /></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OlpkWym9YsQ/U9FwzsNaeDI/AAAAAAAAAkI/lmJBKipsY0A/s640/blogger-image-1237055518.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OlpkWym9YsQ/U9FwzsNaeDI/AAAAAAAAAkI/lmJBKipsY0A/s640/blogger-image-1237055518.jpg" /></a></div><br /></div><div>Are people too anal to leave a sheet hanging from the dispenser? Because you really have to try hard to tear it off right at the top. I can tell you that this is how it's supposed to look when you leave the restroom, for the convenience the folks who come in after you.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>That's about it.</div><div><br /></div><div>This has been a public service message of sorts.
