It's a portrait inspired by my all-time favorite Halloween blog, <a href="http://theskullpumpkin.blogspot.com/">The Skull and Pumpkin</a> of Mike Cathcart's. The updates have been spotty over these past few years, but the back content is well worth discovering for yourself. If you do take a look, be sure to leave a comment in appreciation. He still reads those.<br /><br />To win the photo, see if you can guess my first iTunes Music Store purchase.<br /><br />Was itâ€¦<br /><br />1. Dreams, by The Cranberries<br />2. Heart and Soul, by Huey Lewis &amp; The News<br />3. It Was a Good Day, by Ice Cube<br />4. Wichita Lineman, by Glen Campbell<br />5. Steppin Out, by Joe Jackson<br />6. Never, Never Gonna Give You Up, by Barry White<br />7. Time, by Boy George<br />8. Hummingbird, by Seals &amp; Crofts<br />9. Future Song (Love a Good Woman, Love a Good Man), by Curtis Mayfield<br />10. Knockin' On Heaven's Door, by Eric Clapton<br /><br />Think you know? Leave a comment. You get one guess only. The first to guess correctly wins. I'll even autograph it if you want. Good luck.<br /><br />
