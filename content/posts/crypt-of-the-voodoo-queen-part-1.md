The doctors said Dad needed a triple&nbsp;</span>bypass. I and my brothers were going to be there with him through the surgery and early recovery. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Cz49ZiTOsBw/VObEnlTdNiI/AAAAAAAABtc/4IcJ4jBl6uw/s2048/concessions.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Cz49ZiTOsBw/VObEnlTdNiI/AAAAAAAABtc/4IcJ4jBl6uw/s2048/concessions.jpg" height="480" width="640" /></a></div><br />I was naturally concerned about my Dad, but confident that he was receiving good care in New Orleans. As a result I was mostly looking forward to seeing him and spending a little time with my brothers in the Big Easy. The Louis Armstrong International Airport was impressive, cleaner and prettier than I imagined. More so than the far larger DFW International I had just left. I felt like my trip was off to a good start.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-T6PO8x5CzA0/VObGUjrwqiI/AAAAAAAABto/KW_lQdUOGb0/s2048/hall.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-T6PO8x5CzA0/VObGUjrwqiI/AAAAAAAABto/KW_lQdUOGb0/s2048/hall.jpg" height="640" width="544" /></a></div><br />This was the first time I had stepped on a plane since 9/11. Overall I found the security checks and TSA agents to be less of a hassle than I had anticipated. After gliding through the checkpoints, I took a little time to explore the cavernous halls and alleys of the airport.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iXJlDdAfLcs/VObJA6-P0HI/AAAAAAAABt0/Vv-1urpY4Uk/s2048/mick.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iXJlDdAfLcs/VObJA6-P0HI/AAAAAAAABt0/Vv-1urpY4Uk/s2048/mick.jpg" height="480" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fwpfVp5ynX0/VObJA_zhBGI/AAAAAAAABt4/Z5edzDyjIYY/s2048/jackie.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fwpfVp5ynX0/VObJA_zhBGI/AAAAAAAABt4/Z5edzDyjIYY/s2048/jackie.jpg" height="480" width="640" /></a></div><br />
