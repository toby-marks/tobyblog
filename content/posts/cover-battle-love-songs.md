It's time once again for one of my patented YouTube cover battles, and in typical fashion you pick the winner. Tonight's theme is one of my favorite for YouTube covers — LOVE SONGS. I have my personal favorite, of course, but I won't spoil it for you. Enjoy, and leave a comment to vote for the winner. <br /><br />The first track is by <a href="http://www.gogamusic.com">Goga</a>, a local (Dallas) wedding singer and one-man-band act. This was actually filmed at a performance in downtown Dallas in 2008. Go Goga! <br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/k9sQJOC2sxA" width="480"></iframe><br /><br />Next up is YouTube artist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RPreston01/featured">Rob Preston</a> singing Billy Joel's Just The Way You Are. Barry White did do a nice cover of this song, but I still prefer Joel's version. But Preston's cover is not bad, and songs seem more soulful when sung alone in your office/living room. <br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/fWF5OySj2WA" width="480"></iframe><br /><br />Last we have professional musician <a href="https://www.judeperl.com">Jude Perl</a> singing an offbeat rendition of Marvin Gaye's classic. A good attempt at a viral hit? You be the judge. <br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3UVcxHh-0e4" width="480"></iframe>
