The weather was warmer today. I could feel spring in my bones. I get that way around this time of year. Maybe I was feeling a little homesick. Whatever the case, I've been craving Mexican food. I noticed this little while walking around during my lunch break. 

As I was standing outside the door reading the posted menuboard, an older lady passing by said to me "Go in. You'll like it. It's really good." I took that as a sign.

The place had very limited seating, but at 6:00pm I had it all to myself. I ordered two of the "Gubernador", basically fancy shrimp tacos with a light and pleasant cream sauce. I noticed some Tajin on a shelf behind the counter, so I asked them to reach it for me. It provided a little extra seasoning for the shrimp.

And they had Topo. God bless these people. I could have had a cerveza, I suppose, but I wasn't feeling it today.

The tacos were fantastic. That sauce made all the difference. The soft corn tortillas held up, too. No splitting or crumbling. I ordered chips and guacamole and the guac was especially good, I thought. A bit more garlic in it than at the El Portal, which is a good thing, trust me.

*Rating:* Superior. I will absolutely be back. Tacos a little on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for.
