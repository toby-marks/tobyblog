Straight off a Dollar Store shelf at the lovely Grapevine Mills Mall in Grapevine, Texas, and stocked just a few bins over from the storied <a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/04/skittles-four-ways.html" target="_blank">Orchard Skittles</a>, comes Kranky Candy, the coffee dusted confection you will soon come to know and love. Is it an afternoon snack? A breakfast substitute? Repurposed industrial by-product? You decide.<br /><br />Joining me in his first proper appearance* on Tobyblog is my good friend Brian Hammons of <a href="http://reviewtheworld.com/">ReviewTheWorld.com</a>.<br /><br />Together we sample.<br /><br />We discover.<br /><br />And we bring our findings to the world. Enjoy.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h3W97HQWuEo" width="560"></iframe><br /><br />(* The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/11/review-world-comes-to-dallas.html" target="_blank">beer review</a>, shot as it was on an already shaky stomach, and with a lame furtive effort to avoid being spotted by the patrolling cops,&nbsp;hardly counts. -TJM)
