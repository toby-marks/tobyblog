<span style="font-family: inherit;">This is an older review from TheVCubeSolver and I very much inspired by the hijinks of Brian Hammons and the gang over at <a href="http://reviewtheworld.com/">Review the World</a>. In it we take a look at a couple of different varieties of Taki's chips and some cane sugar soda pops we picked up at the local coffee shop.  </span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Oh, and you'll notice I'm calling myself "Meeks, the Pedestrian". Cause we were trying to have code names or something. Never stuck. Leonard Mead is the main character from Ray Bradbury's short story The Pedestrian. Leonard Meeks is an actual guy, and I got the names confused somehow. Cause I suck.  </span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0luO86BwwUo" width="560"></iframe></span><br /><br />
