Garden Ridge recently declared bankruptcy, and are now being reincorporated as At Home. But true to form, the seasons still come early there and stay late.

My dear wife noticed yesterday that one of the nearby stores had been refurbished, so we decided to drop in and check it out. I of course had high hopes for what to expect, and I wasn't disappointed.

Indeed, Halloween and fall are in full swing there.

I was hoping that maybe they'd have a display shelf set up with some early goodies, but it looked like they already had most of their yard and interior decorations out on the shelves.

TheVCubeSolver and I just looked at each other in amazement. I had to remind myself that outside it was 103 degrees and felt more like 110, and still July. We hadn't even hit the dog days yet, and hatch chili season and the overall magic of late summer was still a few weeks away.<br /><br />Inside that store it was a cold first of October.

Making her appearance this year is the Witch of the West, and I have to say she makes a pretty good lawn ornament.

The quality of the pieces was generally pretty amazing, and there were some real bargains to be found.

Mixed in among the Halloween merch at the front of the store were a few token pieces offering a nod to that oft-neglected and under-appreciated other fall holiday, Thanksgiving.

They had a really large selection of stock which consisted of three large display shelves at the store entrance, with at least 7-10 rows of shelves that stretched off to the right.

I think At Home/Garden Ridge deserves a round of applause.

TheVCubeSolver dressed up as Napoleon a couple of years ago. Hey look, they misspelled it!

These guys were awesome and one of the most lifelike (death-like?) pieces on the shelves.

Been wanting one of these forever, it seems.

These ladies seem more like they're in pain than anything else.

ThePonyOwner says the theme this year is ghosts &amp; spiders. We'll see if this guy makes an appearance.
