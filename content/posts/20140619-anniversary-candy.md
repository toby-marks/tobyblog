Aren't I lucky? How many guys get to have a truly one of a kind candy made just for them?

What you are looking at is an out of this world treat that I have dubbed "Anniversary Candy". Made by my wife, purely for my own enjoyment.

She made the first batch a few years ago for Christmas, and it's been a special request of mine ever since on celebratory occasions.

This batch was made with almond butter, pecans, cashews, macadamia nuts, honey, and chocolate. There's a little sprinkling of Kosher salt on top for a flavor kick.

I've always thought we could sell this stuff and make millions. I contemplate that sometimes, when I pull another candy shard out of the freezer. I'm a very rich man.
