Not a bad idea, but it already looks like you messed it up.

This should not ever be done, for any reason.

Are you scared yet? Because not even Halloween is safe from the RBG promotional juggernaut. You wanted your spooky time free of tiresome political posturing? ***Well she just dropped a dissenting opinion on your ass.***
