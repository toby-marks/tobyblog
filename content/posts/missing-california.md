I suppose it can't be helped; every year as March drags into April, as the days get hotter and the brief Texas spring looks more toward the summer, the early zeal of the Lenten discipline wears off, and the sacrifices once willingly undertaken become an annoyance and a burden. These things are only compounded by the enforced isolation and the looming prospect of an almost anti-climatic, if not mildly depressing, Pascha undertaken as it is this year without the usual joy of communal celebration. I find myself thinking about freer times, without all these restrictions on movement and enjoyment. We — the whole family, really — have been fantasizing about another vacation, though I expect there won't be anywhere to go to for quite some time. I was chatting with a colleague today and I realized I missed California; miss in a sense my old travel schedule and working lifestyle. Pasadena was beautiful. Interesting. It was a great working experience on top of everything. I like to travel, let's face it. I like exploring, and I always have. I'm glad I had the good fortune to share that with my wife Kassi, on our second most memorable trip together anywhere. 

To commemorate those times, I thought I'd put together this [collection of my California blogs]({{< ref "/tags/california" >}}) for both you and me to revisit and reminisce. Enjoy.
