I discovered the The Bird and Bee this past December when I heard their rendition of [The Twelve Days of Christmas]({{< ref "/posts/2018-12-21-my-favorite-christmas-songs.md" >}}) at a bar in Honolulu. That led me to this album, and I've been burning it up lately on drives and at work.

It's total ear candy.

I really love the neo-80s, Synthwave-y spin they put on these old chestnuts. They somehow make the songs sound both old and new at the same time.

That driving beat and those smooth, flat vocals. I love her voice, and I love this song.

Although they stick rigidly to Hall and Oates's original musical interpretations, the funky retro instrumentation and her dreamy voice give new life to these songs. They're the rare covers that completely honor the original material, while standing up as unique works in their own right.

I hope you like this stuff as much as I do.
