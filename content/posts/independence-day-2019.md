There’s no denying we live in troubled times in this country. Shared celebrations are a respite from the hate that seems set to smother our culture. They also serve as milestones, reminding us of the passage of time and providing a useful historical perspective on our own lives and the times we share with each other. For our part, we plan to celebrate like we haven’t in a while, venturing down to the mall later for the big party, then fireworks later tonight. Before that I’ll be grilling pizzas in the backyard, and I hope to get a lot of today on camera.

What are you doing to celebrate? I’d like to know.
