Once again we were proud to host buddy Brian Hammons of the food/candy/retro/life blog Review the World as he made his way down to Dallas for the big UFC 185 fight night. What a weekend! Among other things, I introduced Brian Hammons to some of the best tacos in the COUNTRY. Go see what resulted over on [reviewtheworld.com.](http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/03/texas-taco-challenge-taco-naan-vs-fuel.html)
