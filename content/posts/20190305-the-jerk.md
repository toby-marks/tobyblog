I've had this song stuck in my head for a couple of days, and maybe if I post it I can get rid of it. It's from The Jerk, and features Bernadette Peters, my first screen crush when I was just a little kid. That bit at the end where she pulls out the coronet still cracks me up. Still, it's a touching scene, don't you think? A little reminder that life can be sweet sometimes.
