<span style="font-family: inherit;">Back in the summer of 2013 TheVCubeSolver and I dropped by the local candy shop to review <a href="http://www.bluebunny.com/Products/d/Jolly_Rancher_Cool_Tubes">Blue Bunny's Jolly Rancher Cool Tubes</a>, a push-pop like product in three weird flavors. It turned out to be a complete and total sensory experience.  <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/6oEA207lVsc" width="560"></iframe></span>
