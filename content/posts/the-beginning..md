My name is Toby. In spring of 2013 I discovered Brian Hammons' blog <a href="http://reviewtheworldblog.blogspot.com/">Review the World</a>, and something clicked. Here was a guy, slightly my junior, getting out and enjoying life with his friends, exploring his local environment, and generally on fire with all the possibilities that an ordinary life offers to those who know how to look for them. I had spent the bulk of 2012 doing all those things with my two older kids while my wife was for the most part, regrettably, stuck at home working and/or gestating. It was a magic year open to all sorts of new experiences. That all ended, or seemed to, with the arrival of the new baby and all the familiar responsibilities that go along with that. Brian's videos, especially the <a href="http://reviewtheworldblog.blogspot.com/search/label/Go%20Road%20Trip">GO! Road Trip</a> series, seemed to crystalize that sense of adventure and exploration I was missing at the moment, and which I sorely missed experiencing with the kids, at least as frequently as we had grown accustomed to. I wound up contacting Brian to tell him how much I liked his videos, and to encourage him to make more. And now, the better part of a year later, he is encouraging me to join him in this little online party. Challenge accepted. My intent for this site is somewhat different than Brian's for Review the World; that being said, I refuse to allow myself to constrain its potentialities. The site will grow organically, entertaining this or that whim or obsession, observing the seasons and responding to events. But a few core ideas will no doubt shape and permeate its essence for its natural life span, and those do not bear mentioning now, as they will become obvious soon enough. Thank you for reading.  <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NINi6nq-3-4/Uu8zF8xolxI/AAAAAAAAAN0/zGt8pKEQQt0/s1600/photo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NINi6nq-3-4/Uu8zF8xolxI/AAAAAAAAAN0/zGt8pKEQQt0/s1600/photo.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><br />
