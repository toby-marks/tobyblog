Well, well. And I thought they'd retired. I suppose there are still a few living acts I'd pay to see after all. 🐦🐝  No idea whether we'll make it out to this one, but might bee nice.

[Read all about my love for their Hall and Oates cover album]({{< ref "bird-and-the-bee.md" >}}). And give those songs a deep listen.
