I can't claim that I was one who helped to postpone the extinction. Somebody told me once as a kid that it contained pig's brains, so I never ate it. It pretty much looked like jello'd meat, too, which didn't add to the appeal. I'd try it today, though, if I still lived there, and probably would like it. Vinegar and pork is not a bad combo.
