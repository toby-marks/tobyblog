This is a tribute video to my brother. You can think of it as the pilot episode of a fictional reality show series. It includes some backyard wrestling, a special cooking segment also featured in the [2015 Thanksgiving Special]({{< ref "videos/the-tobyblog-thanksgiving-special.md" >}}), and a frog tossing competition using actual Louisiana bull frogs. It is wild, and like the man himself, not quite safe for work!
