This video is something of a personal achievement, having been now just under two years in the making, and passing, as it does, yet another milestone in the revitalization of this little blog. Yeah, I know, that's sort of a grandiose way to introduce a video where I discuss the merits of quail eggs and potato chips with friends and family, but there we are. It means something to me — hard to quantify — to be active on the site again. Time slips away from us so fast. 

Maybe it's just that time of year, but I find myself in a contemplative mood tonight. 

Part of the reason I took up this little adventure in the first place was that I saw the value in capturing these moments. I know they'll be important for later. 

*You* tune in for the straight dope on **Texas versus Louisiana quail eggs**. (Who has the better take?)

*You* tune in for the verdict on **Zapp's Voodoo Heat potato chips**. (Are they kicked up to notches unknown? Or all too known?)

*You* tune in for the word on Swamp Pop's strawberry soda, **Pop Rouge**. (I think I used to live down the street from that guy.)

*I* tune in for a glimpse of my son at 16 years old. An old friend too long away. A summer day gone by. That's the essence of real nostalgia, right? It's always personal. 

Enjoy.
