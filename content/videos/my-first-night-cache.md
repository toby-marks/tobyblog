Come along with the kids and I on our first night caching adventure. For the uninitiated among you, night caching is simply [geocaching](http://www.geocaching.com/) at night. Generally night caches are made so that you can't find them during the daytime, by making use of trails of reflective tacks or tape or other forms of guidance visible only at night.
