The Super Mega Fun Pack geocache ([GC5Z4X7](http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5Z4X7_super-mega-fun-pack?guid=2b17d678-ce39-469a-bb79-675f048e81f2)) is a thinly-veiled tribute to Matt of [dinosaurdracula.com](http://dinosaurdracula.com/) and the amazing box of goodies that he puts together every month for his hordes of devoted fans. It's only "veiled" at all because of the (understandable) policy of geocaching.com not to list any cache with references to commercial products. After going back and forth with them a bit about this, I relented and removed any overt references to Matt or his website, including changing the name of the cache from the original "The Dino Drac Fun Pack Geocache" to "Super Mega Fun Pack". It's hidden somewhere in Garland, Texas, for you adventurous types.
