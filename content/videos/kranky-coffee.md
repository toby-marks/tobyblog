Straight off a Dollar Store shelf at the lovely Grapevine Mills Mall in Grapevine, Texas, and stocked just a few bins over from the storied [Orchard Skittles](http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/04/skittles-four-ways.html), comes Kranky Candy, the coffee dusted confection you will soon come to know and love. Is it an afternoon snack? A breakfast substitute? Repurposed industrial by-product? You decide.

Joining me in his first proper appearance* on Tobyblog is my good friend Brian Hammons of [ReviewTheWorld.com](http://reviewtheworld.com/).

Together we *sample*.

We *discover*.

And we bring our findings to the world. Enjoy.

(* The [beer review]({{< ref "/posts/review-the-world-comes-to-dallas.md" >}}), shot as it was on an already shaky stomach, and with a lame furtive effort to avoid being spotted by the patrolling cops, hardly counts. -TJM)
