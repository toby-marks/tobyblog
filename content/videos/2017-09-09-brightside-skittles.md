Join me, Augie, and superpal Brian of [Review the World](http://www.reviewtheworld.com/) for installment number two in this soon to be _classic_ trilogy of Skittles candy reviews. This time we look at Brightside Skittles, the very flipside of the Darkside [reviewed a couple of years back](http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/04/skittles-four-ways.html) with Brian on his last visit to Dallas. A great theme for summer and sunny days, will Brightside warm your tummy as we slip into fall and all things pumpkin spice? Find out for yourself, as we find out for ourselves. 

Give the video a click and enjoy.
