Back in the summer of 2013 TheVCubeSolver and I dropped by the local candy shop to review [Blue Bunny's Jolly Rancher Cool Tubes](http://www.bluebunny.com/Products/d/Jolly_Rancher_Cool_Tubes), a push-pop like product in three weird flavors. It turned out to be a complete and total sensory experience.
