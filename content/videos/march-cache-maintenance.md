TheVCubeSolver and I hit the road on a pretty March morning to do some maintenance on a couple of our geocaches. The log for [RtW #3](http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC56HRR_review-the-world-series-3?guid=84f80389-4cc8-44a0-8537-6759a73790c9) had filled up and Augie's [beaver cache](http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC55KHP_the-lost-little-beaver) had recently been reported missing. A little town, a little country. More geocaching goodness for you.
