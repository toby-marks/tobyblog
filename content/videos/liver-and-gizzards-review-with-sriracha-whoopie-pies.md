My buddy Brian Hammons over at [Review the World](http://www.reviewtheworld.com/) requested another video food review, so I though I'd introduce him to a down-home treat from my childhood. I hope you're happy with the results. I'm not gonna lie, this one is a bit of a deep dive; a little something for my hardcore devotees. That is, people that like watching me eat stuff in my car. And yes, I manage to add yet another stain to my car seat. For you, people, for you.

While you're at it, why don't you check out some of my other food reviews?
