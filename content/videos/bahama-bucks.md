Katie and the gang over at [Cheap Thrills](http://www.facebook.com/teamsandnuttv) invited me and the kids to do a co-review highlighting some of our favorite summer treats. You can check out their submission, Culver's Frozen Custard, below.

Naturally, I jumped at the chance to introduce you guys to one of the hidden treasures of our little neighborhood â€” [Bahama Bucks](http://www.bahamabucks.com/)!

Bucks is sort of like Jimmy Buffett's own sno-cone stand. It serves sno-cones and tropical smoothies, some coffee drinks, and you can even get mixed fruit cups there if you'd like. They specialize in all the fruity flavors of the Caribbean, and feature plenty of faux-rum, faux-daiquiri, and faux-colada treats. Take a look at [their menu](https://www.bahamabucks.com/menu/index.html). It's huge. And there's a pickle juice sno-cone. Cheeseburger in Paradise, anyone?

And you can also buy snow balls there. Year round!

Come experience some summer zest with Team Tobyblog and the Cheap Thrills crew!
