So what do you think birds talk about? Do you think they gossip? Is there drama in bird communities? Do they talk crap about the hoomans? I don't think they like being on camera. I was spotted taking pictures and it seemed to interrupt their conversation. Once they both saw what I was doing, they flew away.

Almost like a little village. I was looking for Smurfs, trust me.
