Or at least it will be, tomorrow. ☘️

I'm not gonna lie — all this rain can be difficult for me to endure, particularly now with the whole world on lockdown because of the coronavirus. But I guess it's not been so bad. As I write this I see sun peeking through the clouds, and I notice that the streets are starting to dry up. Might be a good opportunity for a short walk, a brief chance to take in some of the only light we've had in a couple days. 

Yesterday I took a moment to try to capture some of the feel. Enjoy the pictures.

How will you folks be celebrating this year? I hope with large pot of corned beef and cabbage and a frothy mug of Irish beer. That, or a pot of gold. 

Right now I'd settle for a rainbow.
