More photos from the Pasadena Antique Mall. I always drop by when I'm in town. At some point in my life I picked up the habit of visiting these places. What I'm ever looking for, I don't know. You never know what you'll find.

It's a kind of blasphemy, but it's worth pondering. Is this our end? Have we arrived at the point where faith itself is just another antique piece of pop culture rubbish, to be  tossed up on a shelf between action figures and old plates, and flogged to collectors of vintage kitsch? We are selling the best part of ourselves for cheap money and no gain, and the rent is coming due.

I stared at this one for a long time. Could it really be an undiscovered species, preserved under glass for who knows how long, traded privately and unknown to science? What if it was?

I'll be back again, to keep looking for who knows what.
