Having some time to kill, I decided to walk over to the big international terminal at LAX for a bite to eat before my flight. Kassi and I discovered this place on our trip to Honolulu last December, though we were trying to make a connecting flight and didn't have time to stop and enjoy it.

It's a pretty place, very modern. Well designed. Felt something like a really large and expensive mall.

There were several good options for lunch, but since it happened to be [National Margarita Day](https://nationaldaycalendar.com/national-margarita-day-february-22/), I decided to drop by this chic little cantina for a chile relleno burger and a drink. Both were excellent. There was a British couple next to me, just in from a flight. I enjoyed listening to their accents. Neither were drinking, which I found odd.

The magic is still around, I am told. One day I might like to go to Orlando and see it for myself.

I stopped and looked at this mural for a while, and wondered what it meant.

I loved the light in this area, and the feeling of being alone in such a large space.

I made a joke on Facebook about "that's how Orange *Julius* got started (Julius Caesar? get it?)" but I think everyone believed it.

Till next time, California. It'll be nice to see you in the spring.
