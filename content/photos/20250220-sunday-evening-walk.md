Sunday evening I took the boy out for a short but pleasantly brisk walk at a nearby park with a short paved trail that sits between a few old apartment complexes and a steeply banked creek. This same area was featured in my [Halloween Special]({{< relref "videos/the-tobyblog-halloween-special.md" >}}), as in certain favored years the fall colors in these trees can be quite gorgeous, particularly in the late evening light. Some of my favorite fall pictures were taken back here. It doesn't get much traffic, either, because it's sort of tucked out of the way and doesn't really lead anywhere. It's also pretty short, which used to work out well for taking our old bulldog for a bit of fresh air.

As I find the time to compile some of my favorite photos I'd like to revive my old "park review series" I started [way back when]({{< relref "20140219-suncreek-park-more-than-meets-the-eye.md" >}}), perhaps starting with this park.
