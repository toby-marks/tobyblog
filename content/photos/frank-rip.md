		<li data-sub-html="<h4>(2/39) Finally Got a Proper Raven Pic</h4><p>Last year driving through Petrified Forest National Forest — and even into Williams, Arizona and all around the Grand Canyon — I saw many ravens. I tried to get good pictures, but because of the limitations of my wide-angle lenses I was never able to get what I considered a satisfactory shot. It was to take pictures of those ravens on return trips that I bought my new camera, the Nikon P1000. I immediately had an opportunity, and I have to say I was delighted at the range and focus of that incomparable zoom. Such a great camera for wildlife.</p>" data-src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48353211382_a180b2970a_o.jpg" class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4 col-md-3">

		<li data-sub-html="<h4>(8/39) The First Cluster of Sequoias</h4><p>I broke out the Samyang 14mm lens for a few shots of our first cluster of giant sequoias. I'm always hesitant to use that lens for 'money shots', because it's a manual focus lens and I don't trust myself. But I've always been pleased with the results.
