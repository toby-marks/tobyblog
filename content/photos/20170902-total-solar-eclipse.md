Some pictures from the eclipse event in Dallas. We got about 80% coverage. About an hour before eclipse maximum I could feel the radiant heat die down and the sunlight took on an evening quality. Overall, fairly impressive and I'm glad so many people were into it this year.

Stay tuned in seven years when Dallas will be smack in the middle of the zone of totality! Tobyblog will be covering that live with a massive eclipse party already in the works!
