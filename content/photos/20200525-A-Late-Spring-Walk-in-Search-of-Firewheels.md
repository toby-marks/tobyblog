The wildflowers had recently been mowed over — God knows why — and the firewheels that remained were not worth photographing. However there was still stuff to be seen, and Kassi took a number of pics herself. 

At any rate, it felt like a fine summer walk before the rain came in.

I think I've mentioned before that I really enjoy taking pictures with the Nikon she bought me for our vacation last year. It's amazingly versatile and puts everything in reach. If I can spot it with my eye, I can usually get a nice close up picture of it. The picture quality is objectively not the best, but you can judge the results for yourself.
