Listening ðŸŽ§

Sunset Mission is my favorite jazz noir album. It's moody, ethereal, urban, and sultry. Excellent for late nights and rainy days, and thinking. Or brooding. It's a double album, which I didn't realize until I received it as a gift last Christmas. The first side of the first album is available on YouTube, but I'm not sure anybody's posted the rest. I enjoy that.

It's a rare album, hard to find and expensive. It was gotten for a steal.
