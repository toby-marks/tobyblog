Listening ðŸŽ§

Sunset Mission is my favorite jazz noir album. It's moody, ethereal, urban, and brooding. Excellent for late nights and rainy days, and thinking. It's a double album, available on YouTube. Give it a listen.

It's a rare album, hard to find and expensive. It was gotten for a steal.

Enjoy.
