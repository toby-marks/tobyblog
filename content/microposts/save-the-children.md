I just want to ask a question

Who really cares?

To save a world in despair

Who really cares?

There’ll come a time, when the world won’t be singing

Flowers won’t grow, Bella won’t be ringing

Who really cares?

Who’s willing to try to save a world 

Thats destined to die

When I look at the world it fills me with sorrow 

Little children today are really gonna suffer tomorrow 

Oh, what a shame, such a bad way to live 

All who is to blame, we can’t stop loving

Live, live for life

But let live everybody

Live life for the children

Oh, for the children

You see, let’s save the children

Let’s save all the children

Save the babies, save the babies

If you wanna love, you got to save the babies
