First off, this. Nostalgia community, we need to have a deep and confronting conversation. It’s time to stop pretending you like The Golden Girls. Nobody but your grandma liked The Golden Girls, and that’s exactly as it should be. Your unnatural determination to make The Golden Girls a “thing” amongst thirty-something _males_ has led to this abomination, and it’s time we as a society put an end to this madness.
