It's summer vacation time again, and I'm as excited as if I were returning to Hogwarts after a summer at the Dursley's — a completely made up expression that I thought of just now purely as an excuse to post the picture below, of which I happen to be fond. Back when I had hair I might have been able to pass off a kind of Harry Potter-esque look. Now it's more like Filch. I've had a few ideas lately for more traditional kinds of posts, but I'm afraid those will have to take the backburner as I work on more trip photography. 

Stay tuned!
