🍂 The falling leaves drift by the window<br>
The autumn leaves of red and gold 🍁

The days grow *shorter* now, and soon we'll hear old winter's song…

Too long away from regular posting here. 

Hope you are ready and waiting to catch whatever autumn we're granted. It'll be on us quickly now, in a flash. And then gone all too soon. May all the badness of this year go with it, and may we never see its like again.
