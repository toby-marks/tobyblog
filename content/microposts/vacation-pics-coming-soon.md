I guess the travel log sort of fizzled out, but I'll be throwing up vacation pics *real soon now*. We had a wonderful time, but to be honest we're reconsidering how we plan our future vacations to have a slower pace, and be focused more on one or two areas. Coming home was unusually hard, what with having to deal with Frank on top of the normal hustle of unpacking and washing everything, and also taking care of some minor car damage sustained during the trip. We're lucky it wasn't a whole lot worse, as we managed to get caught in a hail storm at Red Rock, minutes after this photo was taken.
