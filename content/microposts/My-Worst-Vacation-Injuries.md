We've visited a few spots with some potential for accidents, but so far my worst vacation injuries have been banging my head on the roof of the car unloading luggage (last year; my neck was sore for days), and scraping up my arm pretty bad after tripping over luggage in the dark (last night). It seems I have a problem with luggage.
