Well, the Dad Wagon is officially in the shop, up on blocks, awaiting a complete transmission replacement, which ought to take a few weeks. What went wrong I have no idea. Until then my skies will be the color of my grey sedan loner, and I'll be singing the blues ðŸš™ till I'm cruising the highways once again in my Marakesh brown leather seats.
