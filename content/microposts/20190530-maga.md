I live in Dallas and tonight was the first time I have ever seen anyone wearing a #MAGA hat out in public. Some old guy at Lowes. Just thought I should document that for posterity. And no, he did not appear to be buying any tiki torches, nor was his heart very obviously consumed with hatred for brown people, so as to make me hate him. Just an old man.
