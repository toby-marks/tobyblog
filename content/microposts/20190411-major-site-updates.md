🛠👨🏻‍💻 Major site updates! A lot of you might not be aware that in years past I made a lot of videos for the site. You'll now notice a [**Videos**]({{< ref "/videos" >}}) tab up at the top to make it easy to find those. Also, I've settled on how I'm going to use the [Microposts]({{< ref "/microposts" >}}) feature of blog, which mainly I'll reserve for short text-only updates like these, or short Tweet-like content. As a result, I moved a lot of my Microposts for this year under [Posts]({{< ref "/posts" >}}), which as an added benefit will allow you to comment on my photoblog stuff. Have fun poking around.
