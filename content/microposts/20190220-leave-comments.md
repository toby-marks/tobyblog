Just a quick site update — you can now leave comments! I had that feature back in the old days of the blog, and am only now getting around to adding it back. Hopefully it doesn't drag the page load time down too much. Since the internal URLs for all the articles changed after I migrated the site, I unfortunately lost all those old comments. So leave me some new ones if you feel it. 

Also, I think all the Flickr embeds are fixed. At least I haven't noticed any more issues.
