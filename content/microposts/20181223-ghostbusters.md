Yesterday the kid was watching an episode of the old Ghostbusters cartoon from the 80s, his new favorite on Netflix. The show featured the three Fates, and a journey to the Underworld, crossing the river Styx, etc. I said to him "Did you know this is Greek mythology? These were things the ancient Greeks believed." He looked at me incredulously for a second and asked "They believed in the Ghostbusters?" 🤦🏻‍♂️

I had a good Dad laugh.
