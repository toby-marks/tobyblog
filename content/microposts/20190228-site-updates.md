I made a couple of site updates yesterday I wanted to mention. 

* Now, if you click on the logo image, you'll be taken back to the home page. 

* I fixed the stylesheets for mobile devices so that the photoblog image previews work a little better and appear more consistent between small screen and large screen devices. 
  
Remember to click on the title of a photoblog (like the recent [Scenes from the LAX International Terminal]({{< ref "/photos/20190226-lax-international-terminal.md" >}})) to see the full set of photos. You can click on the [Photos]({{< ref "/photos" >}}) link at the top of the site to see all my photoblogs. 

The site actually looks great on mobile. I think I prefer it that way. Enjoy!
