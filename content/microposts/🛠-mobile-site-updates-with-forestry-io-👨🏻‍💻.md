+++
Some techno-gibberish: forestry.io offers a free CMS service that integrates with Hugo, the tool I use to generate the site. What that means is that I can now update the site from my iPhone 📱!

Hopefully that'll allow me to do something from time to time that I've never done here before — real-time site updates. Capture some things in the moment before they're lost to time and fleeting attention.

Celebrate with me by dancing to this song.
