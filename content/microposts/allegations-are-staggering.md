My feelings on the fallout of the Charlie Kirk shooting are, and are likely to be, complex. And I am torn between alternative conspiracies, personal feelings, past statements, and a desire to simply know the truth, which for some reason I still see as important. 

This is a difficult moment to navigate. What they say could all be true. But can it really be trusted? Certainly it feels suspect simply because it happens to serve the unrelated political interests of the people doing the investigating. But at the same time, he was really killed, and we have a firm confession. 

If it seems like idiocy to doubt the current narrative, I would counter that if history has taught us nothing else it is do precisely that. We should proceed with caution. The people conducting this investigation are the very ones telling us **right now** that Epstein's files incriminated no one but himself.
