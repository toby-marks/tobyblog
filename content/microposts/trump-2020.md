Last year around this time I'd just visited a Spirit Halloween Store. This year I've not yet made the trip. Looks like they're back in the same location â€” just across the street from the Barnes and Noble in what used to be a Pier One Imports, I believe. The theme this year is "masks." 

There's certainly a lot to be afraid of this year. Isn't there?
