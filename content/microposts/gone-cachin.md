I have decided that this is no longer a tenable situation. I used to have this entire area covered in "smilies". Time to get busy again.

I've picked out a nice one or two to start with. In addition to _Happy Halloween Hide_, there's another one nearby called _Do You Believe In Ghosts?_. 

Gonna have some fun today. 🍁🎃
