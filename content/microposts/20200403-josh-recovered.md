My brother Josh was released from the hospital a couple days ago after his second coronavirus test came back negative. The doctors believe he had it, and had already beaten the virus by the time he landed in the hospital with pneumonia. He's at home now, doing well. I bought him a cool "I Survived the Corona" t-shirt. Much thanks given to God!
