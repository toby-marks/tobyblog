Well, itâ€™s been a busy few days. Itâ€™s a lot of work graduating a kid. Between that and home and my professional duties Iâ€™ve been swamped. Such is the life of a dad. Since my last teaser post itâ€™s only now that I feel like I can catch my breath a bit and recollect on some things Iâ€™d like to share with you. 

Hope you all are having a warm and comfortable evening.
