It’s adorable the way these Californians go on about their avocado toast. I have heard “avocado toast” dropped about five times in the last couple of days. Reminds me of the way Texans love... tacos? 

I think I’m gonna have to eat some avocado toast before I get out of here. I’ll let you guys know.
