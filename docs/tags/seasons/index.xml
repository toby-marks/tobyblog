      <title>The Decorator&#39;s Warehouse</title>

      <description>The Decorator&amp;rsquo;s Warehouse, located in Arlington, Texas, bills itself as Texas&amp;rsquo;s largest Christmas store. And it is very large. But what really impresses you upon entering the place is just how jam-packed it is with holiday and seasonal baubles, as if despite its football-field size floor space they still did not have quite enough room to fit everything.&amp;nbsp;
As soon as you walk in the door you&amp;rsquo;re assaulted with holiday cheer; the entrance is rather elaborately decorated and serves as both a picture station and portal of sorts into this alternate dimension that feels something like Santa&amp;rsquo;s attic.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re just under 100 days to Halloween now, but there are certain places you can always depend on to roll out the spooky stock a little early. I covered At Home last year and this year&amp;rsquo;s selection looks bigger and better than ever. For 2015 our local store has literally doubled the floor space devoted to Halloween goods. And, well, just take a look for yourself.</description>

      <title>Los Dias De Los Muertos at World Market</title>

      <description>Already a great place to find exotic candies, foreign soda pop, and specialty food items at any time of the year (Brian Hammons, you know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about), World Market really comes alive for Halloween. If you&amp;rsquo;ve got one in your area, get down there right now and check their selection. The stuff they carry is definitely outside of the Target/Big Lots/Dollar Store Halloween mold, but that&amp;rsquo;s not to say it&amp;rsquo;s super expensive.</description>

      <description>Greetings, friends! It&amp;rsquo;s been a few days since my last update, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been idle. Have you noticed how early the stores are stocking for Halloween this year? I blogged about my first sighting at At Home&amp;nbsp;(formerly Garden Ridge)&amp;nbsp;which was on July 1st, a full one month earlier than last year. (And if you&amp;rsquo;re interested, that was at a chain called Home Goods, where the theme of ravens &amp;amp; blackbirds predominated.</description>

      <title>Halloween Has Arrived at At Home</title>

      <description>Garden Ridge recently declared bankruptcy, and are now being reincorporated as At Home. But true to form, the seasons still come early there and stay late.
My dear wife noticed yesterday that one of the nearby stores had been refurbished, so we decided to drop in and check it out. I of course had high hopes for what to expect, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t disappointed.

Indeed, Halloween and fall are in full swing there.</description>

      <description>Technically spotted on July 1 at Michaels. Thanks to The Swagger Mom for the tip-off about fall going up this week. That made me wonder, and my suspicions checked out.&amp;nbsp;

And yeah, it was mostly generic fall decorations on a couple of shelves, but over on the other side of the store, on a lonely end cap display, there was this:

Unmistakable. Halloween ribbon.

Frankensteins, witches, spiders, skeletonsâ€¦ Have you ever stopped to think how rich Halloween is in iconography?</description>

      <description>In fact, it&#39;s already here. My woodland trekking has been sidelined a bit due to having to nurse a sumac rash, but I&#39;ll be back soon enough. Here&#39;s hoping you guys get out and sweat a bit this summer. Enjoy the late evenings while you can! DST. What a gift from Mr. Nixon! </description>
