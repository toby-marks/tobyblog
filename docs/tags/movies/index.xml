      <description>Today marks the 30th anniversary of two very special, very &#34;eighties&#34; movies that I happen to love. The (legitimate) Transformers The Movie, and Space Camp, which I watched for the first time only a year or so ago with the kids.  I honestly can&#39;t remember when I first saw the Transformers movie, but it wasn&#39;t in the theaters. I was the only one of my group of friends that caught it months, if not years later, after it came out on VHS.</description>

      <description>Are you looking for something spooky to watch as we wind our way down to Halloween, but find yourself bored by the usual fare of cheesy monster movies or gross slasher flicks? Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re in the mood for something a little more thoughtful; a little more substantial, perhaps? Let me show you something interesting.
 Apparitions&amp;nbsp;is a BBC miniseries about a Catholic exorcist who finds himself at the center of a satanic intrigue that reaches to the Vatican and threatens the world itself.</description>

      <description>From a respectful write-up on Texas Frightmare Weekend by Dread Central:
Can we stop calling Texas Frightmare Weekend a “regional con” now? The first reader I met this year was Aaron from Australia, who had flown all the way here to experience TFW as his FIRST con.
I met that guy! Twice. Sat right next to him at the special 35mm screening of Phantasm at the Alamo Draft House in Richardson.</description>

      <description>Here you go, folks, the real star of Phantasm — that bad-ass muscle car! A real thing of beauty, and I&amp;rsquo;m not even that much of a car guy.</description>
