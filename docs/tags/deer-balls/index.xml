        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a tribute video to my brother. You can think of it as the pilot episode of a fictional reality show series. It includes some backyard wrestling, a special cooking segment also featured in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2015/11/the-tobyblog-thanksgiving-special.html&#34;&gt;2015 Thanksgiving Special&lt;/a&gt;, and a frog tossing competition using actual Louisiana bull frogs. It is wild, and like the man himself, not quite safe for work!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7xtj-sTj26g&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;After taking some time off to contemplate the overwhelming success of my Burger King poop tweet*, we now return to our regularly scheduled programming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In truth October is always a busy month for us and I don&amp;rsquo;t have much spare time for blogging. This past Halloween was without a doubt the best yet, but I&amp;rsquo;ll save that retrospective for another day. For today we find ourselves at the end of November, as grand a month as any. November is when fall really kicks in North Texas, and although it wasn&amp;rsquo;t much compared to the gorgeous fall of 2013, we still managed to get some decent color in a few spots. November to me means the start of prime geocaching season, the arrival of a certain coffee chain&amp;rsquo;s special Thanksgiving blend, (something I genuinely anticipate all year), and most of all our sumptuous Thanksgiving feast, lovingly prepared by my very talented wife. Thanksgiving is a fine holiday, too often neglected these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a real American holiday, in the truest and best sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t intended at the start of my little vacation to do a Thanksgiving special. That was TheVCubeSolver&amp;rsquo;s idea. But I thought it was a good one. And next year we may do a Christmas Special — who knows? I hope you like it. It&amp;rsquo;s got some outdoors, some indoors, some geocaching, some product reviews, and a very special guest cooking segment by my brother Randy as he cooks up a mess of deer balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Happy Thanksgiving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bbt8Bt_3K-Y&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * See Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
