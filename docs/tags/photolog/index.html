What&rsquo;s in a smell? The power to evoke. Memories. People. Places. And special times in our lives. Seasons long forgotten. All brought back in an instant the second a particular aroma hits our nostrils. It&rsquo;s no wonder that scented candles, long thought domain of grandmas and boring little gift shops, have become respected among the nostalgia set in recent years. I read once that people don&rsquo;t remember scents; that you remember the things associated with it or the strong feelings the scent creates, but the brain does not store memory of the scent itself. And now I find myself trying to remember what the woods smell like in autumn.

      #pic { display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; }   Do you remember Collector&rsquo;s Crypt? I wrote about that place around this time last year. It&rsquo;s closed now. I had a dream about it the other night, or rather its next incarnation, which was as a hybrid Christmas/Halloween store. I know the owners have an interest in Christmas things, so that detail is not too surprising. But in my dream, there was also a functional toilet over by the register.

      While in attendance at Texas Frightmare Weekend I picked up a small pocket watch as a souvenir for my daughter from the booth of Diana Levin. Check out her gallery on her website. Or better yet, if you like what you see you can buy something from her Etsy store.

      Being a fan of post-Christmas year end wrap-ups, I decided to create a Flickr set highlighting some of the events and activities that filled our lives this year. These are not my best photos or even my favorites, but just a (largish) collection of pictures that capture the essence of 2014 for me. A little bit of countryside, a little bit of life at home. One or two guest appearances. Flowers and ponies and monsters and toys.

  <p>
    
      Those of you paying close attention&nbsp;will remember that Tobyblog owes its existence to my good buddy Brian Hammons of the nostalgia blog&nbsp;reviewtheworld.com. His site is a surprisingly deep personal catalog that is as much a call to action and personal philosophical movement as anything. Brian has been at this game for far longer than YouTube has been around, and has amassed an unparalleled amount of footage and articles documenting the greater part of his life, from high school hijinks to romances come and gone, to thirty-something introspections with friends.

  <p>
    
      Already a great place to find exotic candies, foreign soda pop, and specialty food items at any time of the year (Brian Hammons, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about), World Market really comes alive for Halloween. If you&rsquo;ve got one in your area, get down there right now and check their selection. The stuff they carry is definitely outside of the Target/Big Lots/Dollar Store Halloween mold, but that&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s super expensive.
