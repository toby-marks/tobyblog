        <description>&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Mrgo_E1r37k/VGLpoDVtcfI/AAAAAAAABkU/2I7G8LsRERY/s1600/IMG_0676.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Mrgo_E1r37k/VGLpoDVtcfI/AAAAAAAABkU/2I7G8LsRERY/s640/IMG_0676.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you paying &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/02/the-beginning.html&#34;&gt;close attention&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;will remember that Tobyblog owes its existence to my good buddy Brian Hammons of the nostalgia blog&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;reviewtheworld.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. His site is a surprisingly deep personal catalog that is as much a call to action and personal philosophical movement as anything. Brian has been at this game for far longer than YouTube has been around, and has amassed an unparalleled amount of footage and articles documenting the greater part of his life, from high school hijinks to romances come and gone, to thirty-something introspections with friends. When I think about the kind of legacy he&#39;s preparing for his children, it gives me chills. They will have a chance to get to know their father in a way, perhaps, more intimate than most of us ever get to experience; a chance to get a look at the man as a man, as a friend, as a person. To know the thoughts he thought, the things that preoccupied him, the obsessions, the sillinesses, the deep things. To see him grow up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IhjiboKlCpc/VGLpoOIKMAI/AAAAAAAABkQ/5xmbAs_m5VI/s1600/IMG_0669.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IhjiboKlCpc/VGLpoOIKMAI/AAAAAAAABkQ/5xmbAs_m5VI/s320/IMG_0669.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was an honor after getting to know Brian through the site and corresponding with him for a while that he chose to visit us here in Dallas. Unfortunately he was only able to stay for a couple of days, so I tried to pack in as much fun as possible during that short time. We both had the idea to film at least &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;for RtW in Dallas, so I planned the itinerary to provide us with as many opportunities for that as we cared to take advantage of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6layUbYMFRI/VGLpoYbQWaI/AAAAAAAABkY/ELH6mqBjKds/s1600/IMG_0677.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6layUbYMFRI/VGLpoYbQWaI/AAAAAAAABkY/ELH6mqBjKds/s640/IMG_0677.JPG&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian arrived on a Friday morning and after a hearty breakfast at the Old West Cafe in Grapevine, TX, I made a rather ridiculous attempt to demonstrate geocaching to him at Arbor Hills. After three successive DNFs I was beginning to think he&#39;d feel I had made the whole thing up, or at least that I wasn&#39;t very good at it. It didn&#39;t help that when I decided to show him a cache that I had already found, I couldn&#39;t locate that one either. &lt;i&gt;He&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;actually spotted it about 20 feet over from where I had last found it, someone having moved the cache slightly. Good grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While at the park Brian spontaneously decided to film a little freestyle walking promo, dedicating it to my son Augie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/_U39R1rOZnQ?list=UUW_rtLNkTmpXQQB2VYFFoog&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;ve never seen Brian&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/search/label/freestyle%20walking&#34;&gt;Freestyle Walking series&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you&#39;re a fan of Review the World, I&#39;d encourage you to take a look. You can think of it as junior parkour, but I like to think of it as Brian and his buddies&#39; (mostly the redoubtable Nick Van Bever) noble attempt to elevate the mundane in life. With just a little effort, anything can be something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/ErlPUDz5Zgc?list=UUW_rtLNkTmpXQQB2VYFFoog&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s a little hill at the park at the top of which sits an observation tower. I took Brian up to see the view, and what should we happen upon on that Friday morning but a random bongo player practicing his craft! He was an interesting guy. We listened to him do his stuff for a while. He seemed appreciative for the audience. He had a hardcore, almost menacing look but was in fact a very affable guy. He told us he played in a metal band, but was trying to break out into jazz. Apparently the market in Dallas is pretty tough for a jazz drummer, because he was having trouble finding a gig. Who knew?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M_c6-QNq1NA/VGdrw4rzvNI/AAAAAAAABl8/1NOqOezxSlQ/s1600/IMG_0681.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M_c6-QNq1NA/VGdrw4rzvNI/AAAAAAAABl8/1NOqOezxSlQ/s1600/IMG_0681.JPG&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was getting fairly warm by the time we left, and that wasn&#39;t the end of our outdoor adventures that day. In retrospect it was a good idea that we stayed away from the house as much as possible, though it didn&#39;t spare us the inevitable. Much earlier that morning I had been awakened by my daughter. She felt sick and needed to vomit. I couldn&#39;t believe our luck. With company coming from out of state! I knew we had been hit like a meteor out of the blue with one of the dreaded super-contagious stomach bugs so common in this city. There was nothing to it but to take care of her and isolate her as much as possible. By morning she was feeling somewhat better, and we assumed it must have been an odd case of food poisoning or something. Fools!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/l1gXTs4cPZo&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Anyway, by that time we had worked up an appetite. One of the problems I ran into when planning the itinerary was that there was just too much stuff to do and eat; it was impossible to fit in everything I wanted to show this guy in just two days. So the idea I proposed was to try a &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/05/dallas-roaming-lunch.html&#34;&gt;roaming lunch&lt;/a&gt;&#34;, and try to hit these three places in Irving that I was enamored with at the time, a little nosh here and little nosh there. Brian and his stomach were up for it, and this is the result. My very own debut on Review the World, and as a superfan of Brian&#39;s it was a real treat. Very proud of this one. Not only did I appear onscreen with Brian reviewing some tasty eats from my own neck of the woods, but I also got to be behind the RtW camera, which for some reason I think I enjoyed just as much.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7cwPDnyN7Lg/VGduW04f97I/AAAAAAAABmQ/M7THXBuJ8UM/s1600/IMG_0685.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7cwPDnyN7Lg/VGduW04f97I/AAAAAAAABmQ/M7THXBuJ8UM/s1600/IMG_0685.JPG&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2TlmD9n26sw/VGduWw7y_gI/AAAAAAAABmU/1YUWm2VO-18/s1600/IMG_0689.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2TlmD9n26sw/VGduWw7y_gI/AAAAAAAABmU/1YUWm2VO-18/s1600/IMG_0689.JPG&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;That night it was off to Bavarian Grill in Plano, one of our favorite places and probably the nicest restaurant that we go to regularly. It&#39;s been rated the best German restaurant in Texas many years running, and it really is a remarkable place. The live music is great and the seating is very cozy, bordering on the cramped, which I find &lt;i&gt;adds&lt;/i&gt; to the charm, perhaps a bit uncharacteristically for me. We don&#39;t normally go on Fridays, though, so we were surprised to find that Friday nights they run a beer lifting competition. Not &lt;i&gt;chugging&lt;/i&gt;, you see, but &lt;i&gt;lifting&lt;/i&gt; — which is both classier and manlier. I approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/3BQ62Dyfeoo&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I managed to catch the very end on video, when they announced the winner. The point was to hold a large, full German-sized beer mug at the end of your outstretched arm while maintaining that arm parallel to the ground. If you started to tire and your arm dipped more than 10 degrees, you were out. It&#39;s an elimination-style competition so the last man standing was declared the winner and invited back for a tournament of champions. Great fun, and a lot of folks participated. Of course Brian and I competed and outlasted all the others, but we finally lost to the guy with the robotic arm. What are you gonna do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xYl6l-QMsxE/VGd3XRGkYdI/AAAAAAAABmo/i-fZX58tQU8/s1600/IMG_0707.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xYl6l-QMsxE/VGd3XRGkYdI/AAAAAAAABmo/i-fZX58tQU8/s1600/IMG_0707.JPG&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The next morning after an outstanding South American breakfast at Cafe de Brazil we brunched at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/07/avocado-california-roll-sushi-garland-tx.html&#34;&gt;Avocado Sushi&lt;/a&gt;, &#39;cause, frankly folks, Brian just freaking demanded it. Brian is a sushi hound, and can pack away vast, vast quantities of rice and fish. I had been talking up Avocado for a while in our IMs, and he just couldn&#39;t leave Dallas without trying it, even if that meant we had to pull off another, far more loaded wandering lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/6kO8mV62Yzs&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what can I say? That place delivers. The sushi menu is huge, and a lot of it obviously caters to more American tastes. It&#39;s a great spot to bring someone if you want to introduce them to sushi, because there&#39;s more than a little for everyone, including those who are squeamish about raw fish. Their presentation is also top notch — the dishes were just beautiful; no buffet bar rolls there. We were in the moment and the place wasn&#39;t too crowded that morning, so we decided to do a full review at table, which is kind of rare thing among RtW restaurant reviews. It was also my son Augie&#39;s first recorded appearance on RtW, and I don&#39;t mind saying he did me proud, as he always does. Both he and my daughter are also longtime fans of Brian&#39;s, though I don&#39;t show them absolutely &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; on Review the World. It&#39;s a PG-13 site, after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9lHTMQjOBQU/VGd-poVnD4I/AAAAAAAABm4/_3v5aRitW58/s1600/IMG_0698.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9lHTMQjOBQU/VGd-poVnD4I/AAAAAAAABm4/_3v5aRitW58/s1600/IMG_0698.JPG&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to Avocado I took Brian and Augie out to World Market to scout for some potential review material. I had something specific in mind, but while we were there we decided to pick up some additional items, because we were really feeling it that morning. I don&#39;t know how we decided on the theme; I guess it just kind of evolved — &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/09/3-green-sodas.html&#34;&gt;three green drinks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/A5gvaCeGLlQ&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;These were some pretty exotic colors and flavors, and I think they made for a great little review vid, and maybe Augie&#39;s best. It felt like we were in Emerald City in that pretty little courtyard, sipping our green sodas. Shortly after that I decided to commemorate Brian&#39;s visit with a series of geocaches in honor of Review the World, and I placed the first one right near where we shot this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/e4XYkECyFfg&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Beautiful Breckinridge park. I love that place. Anybody who doubts its grandeur has never seen it in mid-April, with the firewheels in full bloom. Or maybe in early June, when their time is close to spent, their colors no longer vivid, but still very striking with burnt oranges and auburns replacing the intense golds and reds. We caught &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/06/swamp-pop.html#comment-form&#34;&gt;some of that here&lt;/a&gt;, which I&#39;m glad of, but still not nearly enough to get a real sense of the place. &lt;a href=&#34;http://drinkswamppop.com/&#34;&gt;Swamp Pop&lt;/a&gt; sodas are a sort of hometown novelty, being brewed and bottled in Lafayette, Louisiana where I went to college. What really caught my eye is that they use unique fruits native to South Louisiana to put a spin on traditional soda pop flavors — fig sugar cane cola, satsuma orange pop, etc. I only regret that we weren&#39;t able to get a bottle of the ginger ale, as I would have liked in particular to try that. It was a really fun vid to shoot. Brian had some creative ideas for the camera work, and it came out really well, I thought. The only sad thing is that my final review under the bridge is almost completely obscured by wind, marring what would have been my favorite of the Dallas reviews.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/_SEkyoAPd8U&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I even made a cameo in Brian&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/08/four-small-candies.html&#34;&gt;Four Small Candies review&lt;/a&gt;, where I tried Chick-o-sticks for the first time. Brian attempted to choke a goose with a small chunk of candy, but they were too smart for his ruse. We filmed that segment right after the Swamp Pop review in the same park, with the last bit of juice left in Brian&#39;s camera battery. I think by that point we all felt like we had given him a lot of material to take back to Ohio, much more than we had initially planned. And I know at least I was happy with how it all turned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#39;s basically how I would like to remember the trip, because it was in the hours after that that things started to take a decided turn for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We headed to Dallas proper to hit the flagship Lakewood location of Dallas&#39; own Liberty Burger franchise, a joint that I had been pushing to Brian for months. Gourmet burgers, crazy awesome LTO specials, local beers, Liberty Burger had it all. Unfortunately, in the weeks prior to his visit I had cooled on the place, what with quality slipping at the original location and an outrageous incident involving extremely rude behavior by the wait staff at the Addison branch. I figured we&#39;d give the new flagship a shot, especially since I&#39;d heard they&#39;d put so much work into making the place acceptable to the Lakewood property snobs. When we arrived I was unimpressed. I hate to say it, but I think aggressive expansion has cost Liberty Burger its soul. It&#39;s just not the place it once was. The LTOs have lost their old originality and seasonal flavor, and the quality is inconsistent at best these days. The Lakewood venue, contrary to my expectations, was not on the floor that much different from the other locations. I&#39;m not sure what the fuss was all about. The food was good, I suppose. At least that&#39;s what I remember Brian and Augie saying. I&#39;m not sure I ate all that much, or at all. Because, truth be told, I already sensed at that point what was coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there we visited White Rock Lake where my plan was to film an epic co-review of two entries in &lt;a href=&#34;http://lakewoodbrewing.com/legendary/&#34;&gt;Lakewood Brewery&#39;s Legendary beer series&lt;/a&gt;, the ones&amp;nbsp;dedicated to a couple of Dallas urban legends centering around the lake, the infamous White Lady and the temperamental Goat Man.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/bBI4itQAFMQ&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;The review was rushed, and fell somewhat short of &#34;epic&#34;. We filmed it on my iPhone with Augie doing the camera work. I could tell Brian was somewhat nervous about being busted for having an open container of alcohol on park grounds, probably justifiably. At any rate, I didn&#39;t want to get him in too much trouble down in the Southland, so we ended up doing the review part as quickly and surreptitiously as possible, particularly because we were attracting glances and patrol vehicles were in the area. Also, I had neglected to study up beforehand on the legends in question. And also I was starting to get sick.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;And there was a lot of wind in that one, too.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Still, though, it was fun and I look back on that silly vid as my sentimental favorite from the trip. I think it would be voted the &#34;People&#39;s Choice&#34; if I were to nominate it to myself up against the other five. What do you say?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Epilogue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Brian&#39;s visit was intended to end with a grand spectacle — dinner and a tournament at Medieval Times. Instead it ended with the grand spectacle of my son puking his guts out in the back seat of my car immediately behind me as we were pulling up to the house. There was a dinner and there was a tournament, but sadly I did not participate. I made it as far as the gates of the castle, but once inside I played the part of the medieval plague victim. I spent roughly two hours splayed out on a bench in the main lobby, without shame, while anxious employees peppered me with questions about the horses. Apparently they have a lot of people faint when the horses come out. No, I was fine with the horses. Was I sure? Yes. Was I really sure, because a lot of people think they can handle being in the presence of a horse, but they really can&#39;t. No, I assured them, it was just a stomach bug.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Just.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I eventually had to move closer to the bathrooms. Mercifully an opportunity arose where no one was in sight, and I forced myself to shuffle over to the toilet where I spasmodically vomited up all of the excesses of the last two days, in some sort of surreal karmic purge. I felt like I hovered over that toilet for half an hour at least. When it was all over I cleaned up as best I could and drug myself out to the bench again, telling myself that I felt somewhat better now and could probably even make it home. That lasted for about 10 minutes, then I was down again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I gave Brian the keys, because I wan&#39;t driving anywhere. By the time we made it home Augie was down. My wife informed me that while we were out the baby had started vomiting, and within an hour of hour of our arrival she had started as well. With my last gasp of strength I told Brian just to seal himself in the room and not to open the door for anyone, and not to come out till morning, no matter what he heard happening on the other side of the door. You guys should have seen the look on his face. Priceless. I wish I could have taken a selfie with him right at that moment, with me giving a thumbs up and him doing that face. Exactly the way you want to leave an esteemed and honored guest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;The passing of that night was something awful, something that will be remembered in the annals of our family for many years to come. And as I recall lying there on the couch with the dog pestering me for attention, or a walk, or just out of sheer sadistic pleasure, I think I can say that I hit rock bottom in my relationship with that dog on that particular night. It&#39;ll only be less frustrating from here on out, and I suppose I can be thankful for that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Somehow I was given the grace to be able to drive Brian out to the airport the next morning, a drive that was admittedly and quite understandably awkward. What a note to have to leave on! I didn&#39;t know how he&#39;d feel about the trip or if he&#39;d ever want to come back, especially if he came down with the bug on the plane or on the drive home, or brought some exotic disease home to his family. As fate and good fortune would have it, he never got sick. It took us probably five days to fully recover. Even now I&#39;m still wary of sushi and haven&#39;t tried Swamp Pop since because of the illogical, but very real and completely physical, associations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Brian and I remained in touch and I&#39;m happy to say that my presence continued to be felt in other videos on Review the World and Cheap Thrills, the successor to the old Brian and Tim YouTube series. I even got a name drop once during one of Brian&#39;s appearances on &lt;a href=&#34;http://veggiemacabre.com/&#34;&gt;veggiemacabre.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Hopefully on the balance I&#39;ve added, and not subtracted, from the RtW vibe. Decide for yourself. Brian — thanks, buddy, and you&#39;re always welcome back!&lt;/div&gt;

I was jonesing&amp;nbsp;for chili cheese fries after watching Brian Hammons and buddy Chris smack down on some on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/04/campus-food-review-harriers-nest-at.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;recent Review the World&lt;/a&gt; video. Melters had a few favorable reviews on Yelp and Google, and being so close to the office I decided to give them a shot one day for lunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melters is located inconspicuously in a small strip mall in Irving. The inside of the place is plain, no frills, but newish feeling. The menu had a few attractive looking items, but I was told their specialty are the baked potatoes&amp;nbsp;and cheese fries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5xUtogK6x5g/U3kayvy6YhI/AAAAAAAAAYU/SKkFFVC5A9E/s1600/melters-menu-left.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5xUtogK6x5g/U3kayvy6YhI/AAAAAAAAAYU/SKkFFVC5A9E/s1600/melters-menu-left.JPG&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jcIDikUCDUU/U3kayhd8k9I/AAAAAAAAAYQ/wgAcE0t5DCE/s1600/melters-menu-right.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jcIDikUCDUU/U3kayhd8k9I/AAAAAAAAAYQ/wgAcE0t5DCE/s1600/melters-menu-right.JPG&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;I got the chili cheese fries to go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jBj31kUkjGk/U3kb8jO0EAI/AAAAAAAAAYY/1c4KJYmUMHM/s1600/melters-cheese-fries.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jBj31kUkjGk/U3kb8jO0EAI/AAAAAAAAAYY/1c4KJYmUMHM/s1600/melters-cheese-fries.JPG&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Served up in a big styrofoam plate lunch container, these fries delivered. The portion size felt generous. The fries were classic McDonalds-style, thin and crispy. The chili was decent, and there was enough applied to saturate all the fries without it getting soupy. The cheese was a real plus, finely grated and melted to various degrees, and topped with some chopped green onions. Frankly, that made the dish. The fries and meat were seasoned adequately, and the whole thing really came&amp;nbsp;together quite well. When I get in the mood for chili cheese fries,&amp;nbsp;when I remember that&amp;nbsp;taste from summers way back as a kid — well this is pretty much that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;On the other hand —&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit; font-size: large;&#34;&gt;BURGER FI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;This is a national chain with a location close to where I live. I was working near home one day when I got that craving again, having recently been to Melters, so I floated by to see what these guys could offer. My son is gluten allergic, so I keep an eye out for dining out options close to home. Burger Fi doesn&amp;rsquo;t have chili cheese fries on the menu per se, and maybe that says something, but you can get both cheese and chili as add-ons for your fries. I got a large fries with chili and cheese to go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;This is what I got.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HPtBSLfkwAE/U3kf1WJTkXI/AAAAAAAAAYk/kb5yXQsFZFs/s1600/IMG_0544.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HPtBSLfkwAE/U3kf1WJTkXI/AAAAAAAAAYk/kb5yXQsFZFs/s1600/IMG_0544.jpg&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;First of all, WTF?

Oh, and this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QnsU7YjgmBU/U3kgjtSahCI/AAAAAAAAAZE/QLlHyrfe0WM/s1600/IMG_0543.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QnsU7YjgmBU/U3kgjtSahCI/AAAAAAAAAZE/QLlHyrfe0WM/s1600/IMG_0543.jpg&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;It looked like somebody had used my bag to clean up after the Exxon Valdez spill. Nauseating. Yeah, I pretty much knew what I was in for at that point. But I felt like they were personally challenging me, so I pressed on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9qkfiWxxZto/U3kf1so7zTI/AAAAAAAAAY8/X0RukvzU7ug/s1600/IMG_0545.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9qkfiWxxZto/U3kf1so7zTI/AAAAAAAAAY8/X0RukvzU7ug/s1600/IMG_0545.JPG&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;The fries. They were greasy, but it looked like most of that had been soaked up by the bag. They had that soft, thick-cut feel that a lot&amp;nbsp;of folks like. I&amp;nbsp;don&amp;rsquo;t mind thick-cut fries, I guess, but I generally prefer the more traditional kind. They tasted ok, I guess. Maybe a little over salted.&amp;nbsp;They sat heavy on the stomach. That feeling did not fully register until a few hours later, I can tell you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;I propped the little paper tray of fries on top of the bag, and cautiously began to assemble the ingredients. I had to do half at first, and then the other half later. Although it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like much at first, they did manage to cover almost all of the fries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tgeofYTvDyU/U3kf1tW6vUI/AAAAAAAAAY4/zO2Q0QOwO6A/s1600/IMG_0546.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tgeofYTvDyU/U3kf1tW6vUI/AAAAAAAAAY4/zO2Q0QOwO6A/s1600/IMG_0546.JPG&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Oh yeah, I had&amp;nbsp;jalapeños, too, which I plan to get next time I&amp;rsquo;m at Melters. I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to go back to Burger Fi. The chili and cheese were straight up food service issue. The cheese in particular was that kind of nacho cheese that you get at old gas stations. The&amp;nbsp;jalapeños were fresh, though. (If you notice a little accent mark over the n in&amp;nbsp;jalapeño, that&amp;rsquo;s the auto-correct doing that. I doubt I&amp;rsquo;d take the time.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;So yeah, I finished up, to my great shame. But on the plus side, I managed not to spill a drop of grease, cheese, or chili on my shirt, so I am proud of that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aJDYQSfOoTA/U3kf2F4akFI/AAAAAAAAAZA/cWscQldMz6Y/s1600/IMG_0547.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aJDYQSfOoTA/U3kf2F4akFI/AAAAAAAAAZA/cWscQldMz6Y/s1600/IMG_0547.jpg&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;In the picture there&amp;rsquo;s a little triangular mark in the lower left corner of my shirt, but that&amp;rsquo;s just the cracked lens of my iPhone. The shirt was perfectly clean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Burger Fi&amp;rsquo;s chili cheese fries didn&amp;rsquo;t taste that bad going down, but&amp;nbsp;within an hour I was feeling awful. Felt like I had eaten a brick. That kind&amp;nbsp;of feeling that makes you swear off forever of whatever it was you just had. And so I did. And I haven&amp;rsquo;t had chili cheese fries since. Thanks a lot, Burger Fi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;I once watched The Road to Wellville with Matthew Broderick and Anthony Hopkins, and I stopped watching movies for a long time after that. Burger Fi is like The Road to Wellville of chili cheese stuff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit; font-size: large;&#34;&gt;FINAL JUDGEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Melters, hands down. Burger Fi can go eat a greasy bag full of their own chili cheese fries for all I care. I&amp;rsquo;ll never be back. This was an easy decision, like a choice between a thing that is very good and a thing that is&amp;nbsp;quite awful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Go back, right now, and take a look at my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/02/zyka-indian-food-review.html&#34;&gt;Zyka India Food restaurant review&lt;/a&gt;. Notice anything suspicious about the Chicken 65? Take a closer look at those ingredients.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kOWZdp1hKUM/Uw7fZHHQ_MI/AAAAAAAAASo/PaKzZurs9tA/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-27+at+12.45.36+AM.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kOWZdp1hKUM/Uw7fZHHQ_MI/AAAAAAAAASo/PaKzZurs9tA/s400/Screen+Shot+2014-02-27+at+12.45.36+AM.png&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Jalapenos. Onions. Cilantro. Sound familiar?   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re from Texas or anywhere in the Southwest you would immediately associate that combination with Mexican or Tex-Mex cuisine. There are other similarities, too, like the general spiciness, the use of chilis, or the penchant for using circular flatbread at every meal to sandwich ingredients and sop up sauces.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;This was recognized by my Indian friends, too. They told me about a legend they had that back a long, long time ago some Indian king had succeeded in tunneling through the earth, and wound up in Mexico. As the story goes, he then primarily used this tunnel to share recipes with the folks he found on the other side of the earth (Something like that. The details are sketchy at this point.) And that, son, is why peppers are eaten in both Mexico and India.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;I recall thinking to myself that this could work — not the tunnel thing, but that you could tweak the flavors and ingredients of Mexican cuisine to give it an Indian flare, and that (according to my calculations) the result should rock. So I filed my million dollar idea on the shelf next to all the others and quickly forgot about it. That was 10 years ago. Well, while I was sleeping somebody was raiding the shelf.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Enter Taco Naan.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s1FCfqq7-us/Uw7ftS5FUzI/AAAAAAAAASw/6I8C4JytHmY/s1600/images.jpeg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s1FCfqq7-us/Uw7ftS5FUzI/AAAAAAAAASw/6I8C4JytHmY/s400/images.jpeg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Located in Coppell, Texas, Taco Naan is the realization of my old dream. I first ran across it while scouting a nearby geocache. The storefront is pretty unassuming — even verging on the dive-y. My geocaching buddy Jambone was hesitant to step in to the place, but I didn’t think it looked that bad. I’ve certainly had good food at worse looking places. Still, it gave the overall impression of a newish restaurant gone a little to seed. Once inside I noticed a back door behind the register that opened directly into the alley, which reinforced the impression that the building itself was cheaply constructed, one of those steel frame boxes that people like to turn into pre-fab houses for a few thousand bucks.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coppellstudentmedia.com/2013/10/24/taco-naan-brings-unique-flavor/&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZiGD7cVQXhU/Uw7gLThxA2I/AAAAAAAAAS4/4DwoMN8mQS8/s400/taco-naan-storefront-200x300.jpg&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; width=&#34;426&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;The seating area was small, but adequate for the business. I think there were two or three other people eating lunch. The register and menu stood opposite the entrance. Jambone and I walked up to place our orders. I was curious to get a look at what they offered, at the kinds of dishes and combinations they imagined.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Judge for yourself. Here’s the menu.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6oqomFPbORk/Uw7gamN8ssI/AAAAAAAAATA/hkNW1bUMqIs/s1600/DSC09308.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6oqomFPbORk/Uw7gamN8ssI/AAAAAAAAATA/hkNW1bUMqIs/s400/DSC09308.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3Dhd-o7nYC4/Uw7gcy33DQI/AAAAAAAAATI/jIX_XzsZmlk/s1600/DSC09309.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3Dhd-o7nYC4/Uw7gcy33DQI/AAAAAAAAATI/jIX_XzsZmlk/s400/DSC09309.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;The slogan is apparently “Delicious Tacos in Town!”, which is (perhaps unintentionally) modest. I was disappointed on reading the menu that it was basically a pretty standard taco shop, with a few Indian influenced offerings. One item that immediately stood out to me on the menu was the Lengua Taco, which is beef tongue. This was a dish I am well familiar with, having grown up in South Louisiana. My dad makes an excellent beef tongue gravy that I fondly remember from childhood, though he and I were the only ones that ever ate it. I understand it’s popular with Hispanic cultures, too, so this is definitely one item that I was interested in trying. The Bagara Bowl seemed tasty, but it was more of a straight-up Indian dish and I wanted to get a real sense of the culinary fusion. In the end I asked for a recommendation from the helpful and courteous lady at the counter, and she suggested the daily special, the Chicken Naan taco, which I ordered with Chicken 65 and a side of rice and beans.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;While filling up my soda I noticed something like a buffet bar behind a counter overlooking the kitchen filled with Indian dishes of various sorts. Everything looked and smelled wonderful. By now my appetite was whetted, and Jambone and I shot the breeze while we waited for our orders to come up, which didn’t take long given the lack of crowds.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nXqWDUftc-A/Uw7glgN7nAI/AAAAAAAAATQ/2N5eNq_iuH0/s1600/IMG_4500.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nXqWDUftc-A/Uw7glgN7nAI/AAAAAAAAATQ/2N5eNq_iuH0/s400/IMG_4500.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Mine arrived first, and after removing the tin foil wrapper from my taco I studied the plate. I was a little disappointed. The naan bread appeared to be nothing more than a pita, and the large slice of tomato added to the impression that I was going to be eating a Mexified gyro. The rice looked clumpy and unevenly colored. The refried beans lacked the topping of shredded cheese shown in the pictures, and while they never look all that appetizing under the best of circumstances, these seemed particularly gloppish.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Undeterred, I dug in and was immediately surprised by how enjoyable the taco actually was. The naan bread, though very pita-like in appearance, tasted wholly different than that Greek flatbread. I was expecting chewy and doughy, and what I got was a soft, melt-in-your-mouth smooth dough that cut easily on the teeth, lightly toasted with a millimeter thick layer of buttery crust, just enough to give you that hint of toasty crunch in every bite. The meat was unimpressive by Zyka standards, just little pieces, but adequately proportioned and well seasoned. The flavor was all Indian. The “fusion” part came with the lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream that filled out the taco. It was enjoyable start to finish, and left me curious about their other taco options.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;The rice and beans, though, were a different story. I got the sides to try to augment the fusion quality of the meal, but I was greatly disappointed in the quality. They tasted no better than they looked. The rice was clumpy and gummy. The beans were bland and tasteless. Both were tepid, flavorless, and unappealing. Sad, too, because I’ve always held a plate of rice and beans to be the best indicator of the overall quality of any Mexican restaurant. These didn’t speak well of the place.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;So was it worth it?   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Absolutely. For five or six bucks I got a soda, a killer taco, and some lackluster sides. Disappointing as they were, I figured next time I could just skip the rice and beans, or better yet, try the Biryani. A couple of dishes still called to me, like the Taco Lengua. They place could use some sprucing up, maybe, and a bigger disappointment is the lack of imagination evident in the menu. It just doesn’t have enough of a fusion quality to it, in my opinion. The menu is something like 70% Mexican, 20% Indian, and maybe 10% truly “mixed”. Still, though, they have a winning idea. All the ingredients are there. They call themselves Taco Naan and they deliver on both the Taco and the Naan. And that’s a good start.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;I’ll be returning to Taco Naan, because if nothing else they count as the only fast food Indian place I can think of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
