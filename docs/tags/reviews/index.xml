        <title>America Skittles Review with Brian</title>
        <link>http://tobyblog.com/posts/america-skittles-review/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello again, folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while now since I&amp;rsquo;ve been active on this site, but life has not held still for me and the family. Since the last time I posted anything of significance, quite a great deal has happened, actually, much of which was originally destined for publication here. Well, as it does, life got in the way, priorities shifted, my free time diminished, etc. etc. — and the gist of it all is that you folks were left unattended for many months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, my hope is to change that situation, especially as we draw nearer to that weird season both blessed and profane, which has become so dear to my heart over the last several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have things to show you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you will indulge me if quite a few of those things involve a short trip back in time to catch you up on all the adventures of the past year. They will be new experiences to you, at any rate, though they might necessarily arrive just a bit out of season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better late than never, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to today&amp;rsquo;s post. This June we were delighted to once again host our good friend Brian Hammons of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;ReviewTheWorld.com&lt;/a&gt; as he made his long-awaited return trip to Dallas. The story of that visit is worth a blog in itself. Needless to say, some hot summer fun, fresh eats, and review-worthy times were had by all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what better way to commemorate that occasion than by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/04/skittles-four-ways.html&#34;&gt;revisiting one of my favorite joint-review projects&lt;/a&gt; with Augie and Brian, the now traditional Skittles multi-way review, in which we launch into some new seasonal varieties promising plenty of explosive and sometimes oddball candy flavors. First up — America Skittles, filmed in plenty of time for Independence Day celebrations, but only released today, with fall peeking around the corner. Such is life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, it&amp;rsquo;s good to be back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year again folks, that magical time between Christmas and New Year where thoughtful commentators like myself come out with their end of year retrospectives; and continuing a tradition I established a couple of years back on this site, I intend to give you my take on the best of my buddy Brian Hammons&amp;rsquo; output over on the internet&amp;rsquo;s most beloved nostalgia blog, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;ReviewTheWorld.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can catch up on previous years&amp;rsquo; content by taking a look at my other lists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/top-10-review-the-world-episodes-of-2013/&#34;&gt;Top 10 Review the World Episodes of 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/top-10-review-the-world-episodes-of-2014/&#34;&gt;Top 10 Review the World Episodes of 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s get into it. Here are my pics for the top 10 episodes of the 2015-2016 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-rtw-makes-dark-outries-snack-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2016-06-rtw-makes-dark-outries-snack-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2016/06/rtw-makes-dark-outries-snack.html&#34;&gt;#10: RtW Makes &amp;ldquo;Dark Outries&amp;rdquo; Snack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvLbS7Erwo4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian and Carolina buddies DJD of &lt;a href=&#34;http://darkentriesgothradio.podbean.com/&#34;&gt;Dark Entries Goth Radio&lt;/a&gt; and Will of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.casseroleofdisaster.com/&#34;&gt;CasseroleOfDisaster.com&lt;/a&gt; come up with a supposedly tasty little hors d&amp;rsquo;oeuvre dish as they kick back in the CoD HQ and prepare for a weekend retro nerd debauchery. Have you made your Dark Outries yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you even know what a Dark Outrie is yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;9-texas-taco-challenge-taco-naan-vs-fuel-city-taco-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2015-03-texas-taco-challenge-taco-naan-vs-fuel-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/03/texas-taco-challenge-taco-naan-vs-fuel.html&#34;&gt;#9: Texas Taco Challenge: Taco Naan vs. Fuel City Taco&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEDVIb79Q3k&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you know? I happen to guest star in this one, along with TheVCubeSolver, who (I realize now) has grown an amazing amount since this vid was filmed. The time goes by so fast, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? This was a fun couple of spots to film and features some of my favorite DFW cuisine. And I know Brian enjoyed the hell out of this one, as he has not stopped mentioning Fuel City to this day. Just watching makes me hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;8-snapple-fall-spice-tea-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2016-09-snapple-fall-spice-tea-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2016/09/snapple-fall-spice-tea.html&#34;&gt;#8: Snapple Fall Spice Tea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nEwk8NVcLbM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trees are budding out, the birds are singing, but Brian and Nick are reviewing this fall flavor that reminds you of your grandma&amp;rsquo;s toilet. A dud of a flavor, but some very cool outdoor scenery makes you crave that feeling of early spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-guide-to-goosebumps-2-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2015-08-guide-to-goosebumps-2-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/08/guide-to-goosebumps-2.html&#34;&gt;#7: Guide to Goosebumps #2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only written blog article included in our list, this second installment of the Guide to Goosebumps series sees Brian and I hitting our stride and reviewing some of our most iconic episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-pringles-hot-diggity-dog-chips-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2016-05-pringles-hot-diggity-dog-chips-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2016/05/pringles-hot-diggity-dog-chips.html&#34;&gt;6: Pringles Hot Diggity Dog Chips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PyA7XF-o268&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian and Nick do some serious walking and talking around the old neighborhood trying to decipher this Weiner-colored can full of mustard-y Pringles. A solid and classic Brian-and-Nick review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-kool-aid-great-bluedini-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2015-07-kool-aid-great-bluedini-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/07/kool-aid-great-bluedini.html&#34;&gt;#5: Kool-Aid Great Bluedini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jw6zzOhJRQQ&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the true highlights of the 2015 season, this energetic and spirited review overflows with nostalgic goodness, as Brian tackles one of his favorite 90s Kool Aid flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-original-new-york-seltzer-sodas-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2016-04-original-new-york-seltzer-sodas-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2016/04/original-new-york-seltzer-sodas.html&#34;&gt;#4: Original New York Seltzer Sodas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydAjERM4oxI&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the year of the Crystal Pepsi revival, Brian filmed a rare epic-length review covering five flavors of Original New York Seltzer sodas, all sent to him by yours truly. The beautiful Hamiltonian outdoor scenery as well as Brian and Nick&amp;rsquo;s unique takes on these surprising flavors makes this one a must see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-angilo-s-pizza-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2015-11-angilos-pizza-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/11/angilos-pizza.html&#34;&gt;#3: Angilo&amp;rsquo;s Pizza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/u9ftSETyLAY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restaurant reviews are unfortunately pretty rare these days on RtW, so this sit down food review was a welcome change of pace, covering some genuinely tasty looking eats and a bit of RtW history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-jones-soda-2015-easter-flavors-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2015-04-jones-soda-2015-easter-flavors-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/04/jones-soda-2015-easter-flavors.html&#34;&gt;#2: Jones Soda 2015 Easter Flavors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KyuRCycg9s&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first video review from Hamilton of 2015, this one features some electric Easter sodas and some even higher energy reviewing, as Nick and Brian deliver an exhilarating return to form in the new year. They still got it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-onys-seltzer-sodas-the-sequel-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2016-05-onys-seltzer-sodas-sequel-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2016/05/onys-seltzer-sodas-sequel.html&#34;&gt;#1: ONYS Seltzer Sodas: The Sequel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vcE2pMOsad8&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what might be one of the best, funniest, and most energized Nick and Brian reviews of all time, the boys cover three additional flavors they missed from the ONYS lineup, delivered to them straight from corporate HQ! In return, the boys deliver an honest but enthusiastic review with Hamilton urban scenery as a backdrop. You can&amp;rsquo;t wait to find out what&amp;rsquo;s next in this one, and what these guys are gonna think about it. Very compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you guys enjoy, and check out the back catalog over on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;reviewtheworld.com&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

I&#39;m talking about the very same one my buddy&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/03/texas-taco-challenge-taco-naan-vs-fuel.html&#34;&gt;Brian featured&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on his second trip to the Big D, where he stacked up its offerings against the nationally renowned taco dive Fuel City. Well, they&#39;re still around and busier and better than ever! The place is expanding like mad, doubling its interior floor space and hopefully renovating those dismal restrooms. I wouldn&#39;t know because I&#39;ve never had the courage to try them again. But you don&#39;t go to Taco Naan to use the bathroom, man, so no worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zKzERafMksM/V6z_YT51uKI/AAAAAAAAC5M/4DmGbkbgiZIq01Grv90h9ttpCA13HhrOQCLcB/s1600/images.jpeg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zKzERafMksM/V6z_YT51uKI/AAAAAAAAC5M/4DmGbkbgiZIq01Grv90h9ttpCA13HhrOQCLcB/s1600/images.jpeg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Since renovations started I noticed they lost the old clip art logo on the sign. Too bad, because I know that was a real favorite of Brian&#39;s.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;The menu is much the same, however I swear the quality&#39;s actually gotten better over time. The food and sauces are spicier and more flavorful than I remember from the early days, and I was impressed with the place from my first visit. Lately they&#39;ve removed the soda fountain. Not sure if they&#39;ll get another one after the work is complete, or if they&#39;ll continue to offer only offer canned and bottled sodas. I know a few places like that. Maybe the machines are too unreliable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SZVByTuJkhM/V60A3gxetnI/AAAAAAAAC5Y/psbkNyUYJqoTp_S6kamFTBb0KmVL7SbSwCLcB/s1600/IMG_5442.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;459&#34; src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SZVByTuJkhM/V60A3gxetnI/AAAAAAAAC5Y/psbkNyUYJqoTp_S6kamFTBb0KmVL7SbSwCLcB/s640/IMG_5442.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;One complaint I have about the menu is that they offer Mexican items, and they offer Indian, but there are only a few genuine items of fusion cuisine. It&#39;s a lost opportunity. I noticed they cater to a lot of hispanic work crews, so maybe those guys are not as big on the Indian side of the house as I am. In any event, I decided to try an experiment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I ordered the California Burrito, which is one of those Chipotle-style monsters about as big around as your arm. I asked the lady at the register if I could substitute the Indian &#34;Chicken 65&#34; meat for the standard fajita chicken. Not a huge request, but she looked at me as if I strange. But sure they could do that. They were really very accommodating and although it seemed like they didn&#39;t get too many substitution requests, they knew how to handle it. I had no issues with my order.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hVnt8P9BhQA/V60Dp4lSR-I/AAAAAAAAC5k/iihAld5aGDEf8T19juz42IfjPRNdxSviQCLcB/s1600/IMG_5448.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hVnt8P9BhQA/V60Dp4lSR-I/AAAAAAAAC5k/iihAld5aGDEf8T19juz42IfjPRNdxSviQCLcB/s640/IMG_5448.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;And voila. Mexican-Indian fusion burrito. And it was crazy good. And with some Indian chili sauce it was also crazy hot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I call it the Bollywood Burrito, and it deserves to be prominently featured on the menu.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Did I mention how good this was? You might be surprised just how well the refried beans mesh with the spicy Indian chicken. The stuff was packed with cilantro, as always, and perhaps some extra onions might have highlighted the Indian essence just a little more, and helped to cool down the tongue after an onslaught of green and red chiles. This was a serious meal for not too much green, and very satisfying.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a long hiatus, my front seat food review series is back! This time I feature some of the Waco area&amp;rsquo;s finest gas station Czech cuisine. If you&amp;rsquo;re ever in the area you should absolutely stop at one or both of these fine establishments.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/tobyjmarks/28657569041/in/dateposted-public/&#34; title=&#34;Ace Pineapple Cider&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8520/28657569041_b0998877b7_z.jpg&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; alt=&#34;Ace Pineapple Cider&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beer is great year-round, but summer brings its own varieties. I noticed recently that hard ciders are becoming more popular. I had a chance to sample a new one from Ace, makers of an outstanding pumpkin cider that I am very much looking forward to having again this fall. Their pear cider, available in all seasons, merits a future review. But this one I had not seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it called out to me from the shelf with unabashed summery fruitiness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pineapple.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/tobyjmarks/28657569771/in/dateposted-public/&#34; title=&#34;Ace Pineapple Cider&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8214/28657569771_20d146c019_z.jpg&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; alt=&#34;Ace Pineapple Cider&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the glass it was brilliantly gold and sparkly. A very sophisticated look, like a nice champagne. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/tobyjmarks/28657569491/in/dateposted-public/&#34; title=&#34;Ace Pineapple Cider&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8742/28657569491_474fedca25_z.jpg&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; alt=&#34;Ace Pineapple Cider&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was every bit as light and crisp as you would expect from a good cider. This one is best served served cold. But no cloying sweetness. The flavor was delicate, in no way overwhelming. You got the essence of pineapple without the punch, an effect that was accentuated by the mild carbonation. It was a good thirst-quencher of a cider for a hot early-evening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/tobyjmarks/28657570441/in/dateposted-public/&#34; title=&#34;Shannon Irish Red Beer&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8717/28657570441_72a2d12d6e_z.jpg&#34; width=&#34;427&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; alt=&#34;Shannon Irish Red Beer&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/tobyjmarks/28657570061/in/dateposted-public/&#34; title=&#34;Shannon Irish Red Beer&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8761/28657570061_2fce5f8574_z.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; alt=&#34;Shannon Irish Red Beer&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/tobyjmarks/28657571101/in/dateposted-public/&#34; title=&#34;Shannon Irish Red Beer&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8535/28657571101_9f348a474f_z.jpg&#34; width=&#34;427&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; alt=&#34;Shannon Irish Red Beer&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Shannon red I picked up mostly because of the pretty can. On the back it says that you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to get aromatic hints of raisin bread, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to detect that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/tobyjmarks/28657570771/in/dateposted-public/&#34; title=&#34;Shannon Irish Red Beer&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8883/28657570771_a7569dc4d9_z.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; alt=&#34;Shannon Irish Red Beer&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;It had great color in the glass, particularly with a little light behind it. That&amp;rsquo;s my favorite thing about reds. The head was a little on the thin side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a data-flickr-embed=&#34;true&#34;  href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/tobyjmarks/28657571401/in/dateposted-public/&#34; title=&#34;Shannon Irish Red Beer&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8533/28657571401_13e3189b41_z.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;427&#34; alt=&#34;Shannon Irish Red Beer&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&#34;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;The taste, however, would make it welcome on my dinner table anytime. Just the slightest sweetness (maybe that&amp;rsquo;s the raisin bread?) balanced out the hoppy bitterness. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call it an outstanding beer, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good, comfortable solid one that I will buy again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Happy summer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Tobyblog Thanksgiving Special</title>
        <link>http://tobyblog.com/posts/the-tobyblog-thanksgiving-special/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;After taking some time off to contemplate the overwhelming success of my Burger King poop tweet*, we now return to our regularly scheduled programming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In truth October is always a busy month for us and I don&amp;rsquo;t have much spare time for blogging. This past Halloween was without a doubt the best yet, but I&amp;rsquo;ll save that retrospective for another day. For today we find ourselves at the end of November, as grand a month as any. November is when fall really kicks in North Texas, and although it wasn&amp;rsquo;t much compared to the gorgeous fall of 2013, we still managed to get some decent color in a few spots. November to me means the start of prime geocaching season, the arrival of a certain coffee chain&amp;rsquo;s special Thanksgiving blend, (something I genuinely anticipate all year), and most of all our sumptuous Thanksgiving feast, lovingly prepared by my very talented wife. Thanksgiving is a fine holiday, too often neglected these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a real American holiday, in the truest and best sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&amp;rsquo;t intended at the start of my little vacation to do a Thanksgiving special. That was TheVCubeSolver&amp;rsquo;s idea. But I thought it was a good one. And next year we may do a Christmas Special — who knows? I hope you like it. It&amp;rsquo;s got some outdoors, some indoors, some geocaching, some product reviews, and a very special guest cooking segment by my brother Randy as he cooks up a mess of deer balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Happy Thanksgiving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bbt8Bt_3K-Y&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  * See Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Straight off a Dollar Store shelf at the lovely Grapevine Mills Mall in Grapevine, Texas, and stocked just a few bins over from the storied &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/04/skittles-four-ways.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Orchard Skittles&lt;/a&gt;, comes Kranky Candy, the coffee dusted confection you will soon come to know and love.

You decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joining me in his first proper appearance* on Tobyblog is my good friend Brian Hammons of &lt;a href=&#34;http://reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;ReviewTheWorld.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together we sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We discover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we bring our findings to the world.

        <title>Super Chix Review</title>

If the existence of Tobyblog was not proof of that already, take a look at the above picture. It was a cold, blustery Saturday afternoon and I was visiting nearby Arlington. It was around lunchtime and I had some time to kill, so I decided to walk over to the nearby strip mall and scope out the restaurants. There were a surprising number of cuisines on offer for such a small area, but this place caught my eye. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;Brian Hammons&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;had mentioned to me recently how his buddy Nick Van Bever is a fan of chicken strips and fries. I figured I&#39;d do some recon for Nick, in case he ever makes his way down to Dallas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was walking up I notice this guy standing out in front of the place taking pictures of the storefront with his DSLR camera, and I instantly recognized what was happening. I was being scooped! I have no idea who this guy was or what exactly he was doing, as I didn&#39;t care to introduce myself, but I&#39;d like to imagine he was just another hipster blogger, and that half the people there that day were just working on their blogs. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/restaurants/headlines/20140407-kfc-parent-tests-super-chix-restaurant-with-first-location-in-arlington.ece&#34;&gt;Or maybe he was a reporter&lt;/a&gt;. At any rate, it made everything I did from that point forward seem weird and superfluous, especially since he had a much better camera rig than mine, and was waaaay more forward about whipping it out to get shots of the employees and in-store signage and such, with all these closeups and weird angles and multiple shots. I figured it would be best not to draw attention to myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vi0HTYPVrtI/VH_tqlhYtJI/AAAAAAAABpc/x1yC3ACBSK0/s1600/IMG_0347.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vi0HTYPVrtI/VH_tqlhYtJI/AAAAAAAABpc/x1yC3ACBSK0/s1600/IMG_0347.jpg&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I don&#39;t know for sure, but I&#39;d bet my pics are not quite as interesting as his.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Rei1w_0OewU/VH_tqsZ2saI/AAAAAAAABo0/YYt0DL1JckY/s1600/IMG_0348.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Rei1w_0OewU/VH_tqsZ2saI/AAAAAAAABo0/YYt0DL1JckY/s1600/IMG_0348.jpg&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;The place was smallish, clean, and efficient. The prices were pretty decent. I got the 4 piece tender combo with fries, house dipping sauce, and a fresh-squeezed lemonade plus a frozen custard for dessert, which I assure you I did only for review purposes. It was cold that day! All of that for around $10, which as I said was not bad because the portions were easily generous enough to fill me up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;The lemonade was fresh squeezed and delicious, and left none of that film on the tongue that Chik-Fil-A&#39;s version is notorious for.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b_yzOd_IeuQ/VH_traHUJdI/AAAAAAAABpA/7rJFfJShCdk/s1600/IMG_0349.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b_yzOd_IeuQ/VH_traHUJdI/AAAAAAAABpA/7rJFfJShCdk/s1600/IMG_0349.jpg&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;The fries were like a weird hybrid that hit the sweet spot between McDonald&#39;s classic shoestring style and Arby&#39;s curly fries. They were delicious and had a great texture. The house dipping sauce (they offered several other traditional sauces) was similarly a mix between honey mustard and barbecue. It wasn&#39;t bad, but I wasn&#39;t really blown away by it. I stopped using it about five or six bites in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1RXNbEAvUUs/VH_trqqlQ2I/AAAAAAAABpE/aHeQunVg88w/s1600/IMG_0350.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1RXNbEAvUUs/VH_trqqlQ2I/AAAAAAAABpE/aHeQunVg88w/s1600/IMG_0350.jpg&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;The chicken! Man, oh man, was that good stuff. Imagine the subtle battery coating of a Chik-Fil-A chicken tender, but with some sort of millimeter-thin invisible candy shell around it. I recall the effect being something similar to the waffle tenders at Popeye&#39;s. The chicken inside was consistently tender, moist, and flavorful. A+&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-STxGLPI1KG0/VH_tsMRVNpI/AAAAAAAABpI/gzSZ83YJUYY/s1600/IMG_0351.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-STxGLPI1KG0/VH_tsMRVNpI/AAAAAAAABpI/gzSZ83YJUYY/s1600/IMG_0351.jpg&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Last of all I tried the custard. Lemon-meringue flavor. They offer a large variety of flavors, around 10 as I recall, but if you want a small cup with your meal you&#39;ll have to settle for one of the two flavors that they keep on hand, vanilla or lemon. To get one of their more exotic flavors you need to buy it by the pint. Although it was way too cold for frozen custard, I&#39;m glad I decided to try it because they knocked it out of the park. So much better than soft serve, and I&#39;m a huge fan of soft serve ice cream. Not only was the flavor rich and spot on (it tasted like they used Meyer lemons when making it), but they actually crumbled up bits of vanilla wafer in there that somehow managed to retain their crunchiness and individual flavor. So, so good.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Super Chix is a fantastic joint for a simple tenders and fries meal done right. But it has a weird story. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/restaurants/headlines/20140407-kfc-parent-tests-super-chix-restaurant-with-first-location-in-arlington.ece&#34;&gt;A little research shows&lt;/a&gt; that this is not a chain, at least not as I originally thought, but rather a one-off prototype restaurant from the parent company of KFC that is being used to iron out the bugs for a planned chain of restaurants outside the U.S. market. The Dallas/Arlington location is unique, with no plans to expand inside the U.S. So if you want to experience this for yourself, you&#39;ll need to come to Dallas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I tell you, there are times when I really love living here.&lt;/div&gt;

        <description>&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Mrgo_E1r37k/VGLpoDVtcfI/AAAAAAAABkU/2I7G8LsRERY/s1600/IMG_0676.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Mrgo_E1r37k/VGLpoDVtcfI/AAAAAAAABkU/2I7G8LsRERY/s640/IMG_0676.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you paying &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/02/the-beginning.html&#34;&gt;close attention&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;will remember that Tobyblog owes its existence to my good buddy Brian Hammons of the nostalgia blog&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;reviewtheworld.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. His site is a surprisingly deep personal catalog that is as much a call to action and personal philosophical movement as anything. Brian has been at this game for far longer than YouTube has been around, and has amassed an unparalleled amount of footage and articles documenting the greater part of his life, from high school hijinks to romances come and gone, to thirty-something introspections with friends. When I think about the kind of legacy he&#39;s preparing for his children, it gives me chills. They will have a chance to get to know their father in a way, perhaps, more intimate than most of us ever get to experience; a chance to get a look at the man as a man, as a friend, as a person. To know the thoughts he thought, the things that preoccupied him, the obsessions, the sillinesses, the deep things. To see him grow up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IhjiboKlCpc/VGLpoOIKMAI/AAAAAAAABkQ/5xmbAs_m5VI/s1600/IMG_0669.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IhjiboKlCpc/VGLpoOIKMAI/AAAAAAAABkQ/5xmbAs_m5VI/s320/IMG_0669.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was an honor after getting to know Brian through the site and corresponding with him for a while that he chose to visit us here in Dallas. Unfortunately he was only able to stay for a couple of days, so I tried to pack in as much fun as possible during that short time. We both had the idea to film at least &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;for RtW in Dallas, so I planned the itinerary to provide us with as many opportunities for that as we cared to take advantage of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6layUbYMFRI/VGLpoYbQWaI/AAAAAAAABkY/ELH6mqBjKds/s1600/IMG_0677.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6layUbYMFRI/VGLpoYbQWaI/AAAAAAAABkY/ELH6mqBjKds/s640/IMG_0677.JPG&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian arrived on a Friday morning and after a hearty breakfast at the Old West Cafe in Grapevine, TX, I made a rather ridiculous attempt to demonstrate geocaching to him at Arbor Hills. After three successive DNFs I was beginning to think he&#39;d feel I had made the whole thing up, or at least that I wasn&#39;t very good at it. It didn&#39;t help that when I decided to show him a cache that I had already found, I couldn&#39;t locate that one either. &lt;i&gt;He&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;actually spotted it about 20 feet over from where I had last found it, someone having moved the cache slightly. Good grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While at the park Brian spontaneously decided to film a little freestyle walking promo, dedicating it to my son Augie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/_U39R1rOZnQ?list=UUW_rtLNkTmpXQQB2VYFFoog&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;ve never seen Brian&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/search/label/freestyle%20walking&#34;&gt;Freestyle Walking series&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you&#39;re a fan of Review the World, I&#39;d encourage you to take a look. You can think of it as junior parkour, but I like to think of it as Brian and his buddies&#39; (mostly the redoubtable Nick Van Bever) noble attempt to elevate the mundane in life. With just a little effort, anything can be something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/ErlPUDz5Zgc?list=UUW_rtLNkTmpXQQB2VYFFoog&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s a little hill at the park at the top of which sits an observation tower. I took Brian up to see the view, and what should we happen upon on that Friday morning but a random bongo player practicing his craft! He was an interesting guy. We listened to him do his stuff for a while. He seemed appreciative for the audience. He had a hardcore, almost menacing look but was in fact a very affable guy. He told us he played in a metal band, but was trying to break out into jazz. Apparently the market in Dallas is pretty tough for a jazz drummer, because he was having trouble finding a gig. Who knew?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M_c6-QNq1NA/VGdrw4rzvNI/AAAAAAAABl8/1NOqOezxSlQ/s1600/IMG_0681.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M_c6-QNq1NA/VGdrw4rzvNI/AAAAAAAABl8/1NOqOezxSlQ/s1600/IMG_0681.JPG&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was getting fairly warm by the time we left, and that wasn&#39;t the end of our outdoor adventures that day. In retrospect it was a good idea that we stayed away from the house as much as possible, though it didn&#39;t spare us the inevitable. Much earlier that morning I had been awakened by my daughter. She felt sick and needed to vomit. I couldn&#39;t believe our luck. With company coming from out of state! I knew we had been hit like a meteor out of the blue with one of the dreaded super-contagious stomach bugs so common in this city. There was nothing to it but to take care of her and isolate her as much as possible. By morning she was feeling somewhat better, and we assumed it must have been an odd case of food poisoning or something. Fools!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/l1gXTs4cPZo&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Anyway, by that time we had worked up an appetite. One of the problems I ran into when planning the itinerary was that there was just too much stuff to do and eat; it was impossible to fit in everything I wanted to show this guy in just two days. So the idea I proposed was to try a &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/05/dallas-roaming-lunch.html&#34;&gt;roaming lunch&lt;/a&gt;&#34;, and try to hit these three places in Irving that I was enamored with at the time, a little nosh here and little nosh there. Brian and his stomach were up for it, and this is the result. My very own debut on Review the World, and as a superfan of Brian&#39;s it was a real treat. Very proud of this one. Not only did I appear onscreen with Brian reviewing some tasty eats from my own neck of the woods, but I also got to be behind the RtW camera, which for some reason I think I enjoyed just as much.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7cwPDnyN7Lg/VGduW04f97I/AAAAAAAABmQ/M7THXBuJ8UM/s1600/IMG_0685.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7cwPDnyN7Lg/VGduW04f97I/AAAAAAAABmQ/M7THXBuJ8UM/s1600/IMG_0685.JPG&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2TlmD9n26sw/VGduWw7y_gI/AAAAAAAABmU/1YUWm2VO-18/s1600/IMG_0689.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2TlmD9n26sw/VGduWw7y_gI/AAAAAAAABmU/1YUWm2VO-18/s1600/IMG_0689.JPG&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;That night it was off to Bavarian Grill in Plano, one of our favorite places and probably the nicest restaurant that we go to regularly. It&#39;s been rated the best German restaurant in Texas many years running, and it really is a remarkable place. The live music is great and the seating is very cozy, bordering on the cramped, which I find &lt;i&gt;adds&lt;/i&gt; to the charm, perhaps a bit uncharacteristically for me. We don&#39;t normally go on Fridays, though, so we were surprised to find that Friday nights they run a beer lifting competition. Not &lt;i&gt;chugging&lt;/i&gt;, you see, but &lt;i&gt;lifting&lt;/i&gt; — which is both classier and manlier. I approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/3BQ62Dyfeoo&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I managed to catch the very end on video, when they announced the winner. The point was to hold a large, full German-sized beer mug at the end of your outstretched arm while maintaining that arm parallel to the ground. If you started to tire and your arm dipped more than 10 degrees, you were out. It&#39;s an elimination-style competition so the last man standing was declared the winner and invited back for a tournament of champions. Great fun, and a lot of folks participated. Of course Brian and I competed and outlasted all the others, but we finally lost to the guy with the robotic arm. What are you gonna do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xYl6l-QMsxE/VGd3XRGkYdI/AAAAAAAABmo/i-fZX58tQU8/s1600/IMG_0707.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xYl6l-QMsxE/VGd3XRGkYdI/AAAAAAAABmo/i-fZX58tQU8/s1600/IMG_0707.JPG&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The next morning after an outstanding South American breakfast at Cafe de Brazil we brunched at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/07/avocado-california-roll-sushi-garland-tx.html&#34;&gt;Avocado Sushi&lt;/a&gt;, &#39;cause, frankly folks, Brian just freaking demanded it. Brian is a sushi hound, and can pack away vast, vast quantities of rice and fish. I had been talking up Avocado for a while in our IMs, and he just couldn&#39;t leave Dallas without trying it, even if that meant we had to pull off another, far more loaded wandering lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/6kO8mV62Yzs&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what can I say? That place delivers. The sushi menu is huge, and a lot of it obviously caters to more American tastes. It&#39;s a great spot to bring someone if you want to introduce them to sushi, because there&#39;s more than a little for everyone, including those who are squeamish about raw fish. Their presentation is also top notch — the dishes were just beautiful; no buffet bar rolls there. We were in the moment and the place wasn&#39;t too crowded that morning, so we decided to do a full review at table, which is kind of rare thing among RtW restaurant reviews. It was also my son Augie&#39;s first recorded appearance on RtW, and I don&#39;t mind saying he did me proud, as he always does. Both he and my daughter are also longtime fans of Brian&#39;s, though I don&#39;t show them absolutely &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; on Review the World. It&#39;s a PG-13 site, after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9lHTMQjOBQU/VGd-poVnD4I/AAAAAAAABm4/_3v5aRitW58/s1600/IMG_0698.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9lHTMQjOBQU/VGd-poVnD4I/AAAAAAAABm4/_3v5aRitW58/s1600/IMG_0698.JPG&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to Avocado I took Brian and Augie out to World Market to scout for some potential review material. I had something specific in mind, but while we were there we decided to pick up some additional items, because we were really feeling it that morning. I don&#39;t know how we decided on the theme; I guess it just kind of evolved — &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/09/3-green-sodas.html&#34;&gt;three green drinks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/A5gvaCeGLlQ&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;These were some pretty exotic colors and flavors, and I think they made for a great little review vid, and maybe Augie&#39;s best. It felt like we were in Emerald City in that pretty little courtyard, sipping our green sodas. Shortly after that I decided to commemorate Brian&#39;s visit with a series of geocaches in honor of Review the World, and I placed the first one right near where we shot this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/e4XYkECyFfg&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Beautiful Breckinridge park. I love that place. Anybody who doubts its grandeur has never seen it in mid-April, with the firewheels in full bloom. Or maybe in early June, when their time is close to spent, their colors no longer vivid, but still very striking with burnt oranges and auburns replacing the intense golds and reds. We caught &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/06/swamp-pop.html#comment-form&#34;&gt;some of that here&lt;/a&gt;, which I&#39;m glad of, but still not nearly enough to get a real sense of the place. &lt;a href=&#34;http://drinkswamppop.com/&#34;&gt;Swamp Pop&lt;/a&gt; sodas are a sort of hometown novelty, being brewed and bottled in Lafayette, Louisiana where I went to college. What really caught my eye is that they use unique fruits native to South Louisiana to put a spin on traditional soda pop flavors — fig sugar cane cola, satsuma orange pop, etc. I only regret that we weren&#39;t able to get a bottle of the ginger ale, as I would have liked in particular to try that. It was a really fun vid to shoot. Brian had some creative ideas for the camera work, and it came out really well, I thought. The only sad thing is that my final review under the bridge is almost completely obscured by wind, marring what would have been my favorite of the Dallas reviews.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/_SEkyoAPd8U&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I even made a cameo in Brian&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/08/four-small-candies.html&#34;&gt;Four Small Candies review&lt;/a&gt;, where I tried Chick-o-sticks for the first time. Brian attempted to choke a goose with a small chunk of candy, but they were too smart for his ruse. We filmed that segment right after the Swamp Pop review in the same park, with the last bit of juice left in Brian&#39;s camera battery. I think by that point we all felt like we had given him a lot of material to take back to Ohio, much more than we had initially planned. And I know at least I was happy with how it all turned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#39;s basically how I would like to remember the trip, because it was in the hours after that that things started to take a decided turn for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We headed to Dallas proper to hit the flagship Lakewood location of Dallas&#39; own Liberty Burger franchise, a joint that I had been pushing to Brian for months. Gourmet burgers, crazy awesome LTO specials, local beers, Liberty Burger had it all. Unfortunately, in the weeks prior to his visit I had cooled on the place, what with quality slipping at the original location and an outrageous incident involving extremely rude behavior by the wait staff at the Addison branch. I figured we&#39;d give the new flagship a shot, especially since I&#39;d heard they&#39;d put so much work into making the place acceptable to the Lakewood property snobs. When we arrived I was unimpressed. I hate to say it, but I think aggressive expansion has cost Liberty Burger its soul. It&#39;s just not the place it once was. The LTOs have lost their old originality and seasonal flavor, and the quality is inconsistent at best these days. The Lakewood venue, contrary to my expectations, was not on the floor that much different from the other locations. I&#39;m not sure what the fuss was all about. The food was good, I suppose. At least that&#39;s what I remember Brian and Augie saying. I&#39;m not sure I ate all that much, or at all. Because, truth be told, I already sensed at that point what was coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there we visited White Rock Lake where my plan was to film an epic co-review of two entries in &lt;a href=&#34;http://lakewoodbrewing.com/legendary/&#34;&gt;Lakewood Brewery&#39;s Legendary beer series&lt;/a&gt;, the ones&amp;nbsp;dedicated to a couple of Dallas urban legends centering around the lake, the infamous White Lady and the temperamental Goat Man.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/bBI4itQAFMQ&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;The review was rushed, and fell somewhat short of &#34;epic&#34;. We filmed it on my iPhone with Augie doing the camera work. I could tell Brian was somewhat nervous about being busted for having an open container of alcohol on park grounds, probably justifiably. At any rate, I didn&#39;t want to get him in too much trouble down in the Southland, so we ended up doing the review part as quickly and surreptitiously as possible, particularly because we were attracting glances and patrol vehicles were in the area. Also, I had neglected to study up beforehand on the legends in question. And also I was starting to get sick.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;And there was a lot of wind in that one, too.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Still, though, it was fun and I look back on that silly vid as my sentimental favorite from the trip. I think it would be voted the &#34;People&#39;s Choice&#34; if I were to nominate it to myself up against the other five. What do you say?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Epilogue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Brian&#39;s visit was intended to end with a grand spectacle — dinner and a tournament at Medieval Times. Instead it ended with the grand spectacle of my son puking his guts out in the back seat of my car immediately behind me as we were pulling up to the house. There was a dinner and there was a tournament, but sadly I did not participate. I made it as far as the gates of the castle, but once inside I played the part of the medieval plague victim. I spent roughly two hours splayed out on a bench in the main lobby, without shame, while anxious employees peppered me with questions about the horses. Apparently they have a lot of people faint when the horses come out. No, I was fine with the horses. Was I sure? Yes. Was I really sure, because a lot of people think they can handle being in the presence of a horse, but they really can&#39;t. No, I assured them, it was just a stomach bug.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Just.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I eventually had to move closer to the bathrooms. Mercifully an opportunity arose where no one was in sight, and I forced myself to shuffle over to the toilet where I spasmodically vomited up all of the excesses of the last two days, in some sort of surreal karmic purge. I felt like I hovered over that toilet for half an hour at least. When it was all over I cleaned up as best I could and drug myself out to the bench again, telling myself that I felt somewhat better now and could probably even make it home. That lasted for about 10 minutes, then I was down again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I gave Brian the keys, because I wan&#39;t driving anywhere. By the time we made it home Augie was down. My wife informed me that while we were out the baby had started vomiting, and within an hour of hour of our arrival she had started as well. With my last gasp of strength I told Brian just to seal himself in the room and not to open the door for anyone, and not to come out till morning, no matter what he heard happening on the other side of the door. You guys should have seen the look on his face. Priceless. I wish I could have taken a selfie with him right at that moment, with me giving a thumbs up and him doing that face. Exactly the way you want to leave an esteemed and honored guest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;The passing of that night was something awful, something that will be remembered in the annals of our family for many years to come. And as I recall lying there on the couch with the dog pestering me for attention, or a walk, or just out of sheer sadistic pleasure, I think I can say that I hit rock bottom in my relationship with that dog on that particular night. It&#39;ll only be less frustrating from here on out, and I suppose I can be thankful for that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Somehow I was given the grace to be able to drive Brian out to the airport the next morning, a drive that was admittedly and quite understandably awkward. What a note to have to leave on! I didn&#39;t know how he&#39;d feel about the trip or if he&#39;d ever want to come back, especially if he came down with the bug on the plane or on the drive home, or brought some exotic disease home to his family. As fate and good fortune would have it, he never got sick. It took us probably five days to fully recover. Even now I&#39;m still wary of sushi and haven&#39;t tried Swamp Pop since because of the illogical, but very real and completely physical, associations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Brian and I remained in touch and I&#39;m happy to say that my presence continued to be felt in other videos on Review the World and Cheap Thrills, the successor to the old Brian and Tim YouTube series. I even got a name drop once during one of Brian&#39;s appearances on &lt;a href=&#34;http://veggiemacabre.com/&#34;&gt;veggiemacabre.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Hopefully on the balance I&#39;ve added, and not subtracted, from the RtW vibe. Decide for yourself. Brian — thanks, buddy, and you&#39;re always welcome back!&lt;/div&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My buddy Brian Hammons over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;Review the World&lt;/a&gt; requested another video food review, so I though I&amp;rsquo;d introduce him to a down-home treat from my childhood. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re happy with the results. I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna lie, this one is a bit of a deep dive; a little something for my hardcore devotees. That is, people that like watching me eat stuff in my car. And yes, I manage to add yet another stain to my car seat. For you, people, for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you&amp;rsquo;re at it, why don&amp;rsquo;t you check out some of my other food reviews?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s that time I went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/02/zyka-indian-food-review.html&#34;&gt;Zyka Indian Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The V-Cube Solver&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/02/jolly-rancher-cool-tubes-review.html&#34;&gt;Jolly Rancher Cool Tubes&lt;/a&gt; review&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My famous &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/02/taco-naan-review.html&#34;&gt;Taco Naan&lt;/a&gt; review&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Buddy Team&amp;rsquo;s epic &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/04/thevcubesolver-and-i-review-takis-cane.html&#34;&gt;Taki&amp;rsquo;s/Cane Sugar Soda&lt;/a&gt; review&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The V-Cube Solver tackles &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/04/kryptonite-kandy.html&#34;&gt;Kryptonite Kandy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/05/toe-2-toe-review-chili-cheese-fries.html&#34;&gt;Chili Cheese Fries&lt;/a&gt; throw down&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A tribute to my wife&amp;rsquo;s special&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/06/anniversary-candy.html&#34;&gt;Anniversary Candy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My magic review of some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/07/new-orleans-food-review.html&#34;&gt;food I found in New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; (I won&amp;rsquo;t say where)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;360&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/XHGe3D4sJAc&#34; width=&#34;640&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the recent one year anniversary of our &lt;a href=&#34;http://buddyteam.tumblr.com/&#34;&gt;father/son Tumblr site&lt;/a&gt;, TheVCubeSolver and I teamed up to review an assortment of Snickers bars we found at CVS. And as a special bonus, we take a look at the trendy new Lays Cappuccino potato chips. Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/iUlBK_MChZw&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Orleans Food Review</title>
        <link>http://tobyblog.com/posts/new-orleans-food-review/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;New Orleans is, of course, a city known for its food, home to some of the best chefs in the country. I was in town recently, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d check out some of the local establishments and give you guys a virtual sight-tasting tour. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the hotel vending machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rHaibYXANIw/U8_Hy4ggYiI/AAAAAAAAAio/oW6JSP1QZeQ/s640/blogger-image-1201992581.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rHaibYXANIw/U8_Hy4ggYiI/AAAAAAAAAio/oW6JSP1QZeQ/s640/blogger-image-1201992581.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;Hey, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t eaten all day and I had a couple of hours to kill till my family showed up. This looked like it&amp;rsquo;d fill a hole. Besides, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t tried these before, and they reminded me of those little cinnamon twists you get at Taco Bell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kAqmWLv7-og/U8_ICzlgsxI/AAAAAAAAAiw/ajQAmg-Mog0/s640/blogger-image--134749434.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kAqmWLv7-og/U8_ICzlgsxI/AAAAAAAAAiw/ajQAmg-Mog0/s640/blogger-image--134749434.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;This was a pretty fresh-tasting bag. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t really as sweet as I was expecting for Honey BBQ, but tasted all right. Tasted a lot like regular Doritos, as a matter of fact, with a slight BBQ flavor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bAKjb8Ii_ss/U8_Hu6MpdnI/AAAAAAAAAig/Z9YTXv4-DKo/s640/blogger-image--2139266990.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bAKjb8Ii_ss/U8_Hu6MpdnI/AAAAAAAAAig/Z9YTXv4-DKo/s640/blogger-image--2139266990.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;The twists weren&amp;rsquo;t as delicate as the Taco Bell variety, but much more so than Fritos corn chips. Did I mention these tasted like Doritos? Cause that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much exactly what they tasted like.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2QSCFnKNAmg/U8_IF9JAzMI/AAAAAAAAAi4/XY5b6AB6YHw/s640/blogger-image-281714775.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2QSCFnKNAmg/U8_IF9JAzMI/AAAAAAAAAi4/XY5b6AB6YHw/s640/blogger-image-281714775.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;It also pairs well with chocolate, if you&amp;rsquo;re really hungry. I assume it&amp;rsquo;d go nicely with a Sprite, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t about to pay two bucks for a soft drink. When did vending machines get so expensive?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;VERDICT:&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Try it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I was jonesing&amp;nbsp;for chili cheese fries after watching Brian Hammons and buddy Chris smack down on some on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/04/campus-food-review-harriers-nest-at.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;recent Review the World&lt;/a&gt; video. Melters had a few favorable reviews on Yelp and Google, and being so close to the office I decided to give them a shot one day for lunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melters is located inconspicuously in a small strip mall in Irving. The inside of the place is plain, no frills, but newish feeling. The menu had a few attractive looking items, but I was told their specialty are the baked potatoes&amp;nbsp;and cheese fries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5xUtogK6x5g/U3kayvy6YhI/AAAAAAAAAYU/SKkFFVC5A9E/s1600/melters-menu-left.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5xUtogK6x5g/U3kayvy6YhI/AAAAAAAAAYU/SKkFFVC5A9E/s1600/melters-menu-left.JPG&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jcIDikUCDUU/U3kayhd8k9I/AAAAAAAAAYQ/wgAcE0t5DCE/s1600/melters-menu-right.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jcIDikUCDUU/U3kayhd8k9I/AAAAAAAAAYQ/wgAcE0t5DCE/s1600/melters-menu-right.JPG&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;I got the chili cheese fries to go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jBj31kUkjGk/U3kb8jO0EAI/AAAAAAAAAYY/1c4KJYmUMHM/s1600/melters-cheese-fries.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jBj31kUkjGk/U3kb8jO0EAI/AAAAAAAAAYY/1c4KJYmUMHM/s1600/melters-cheese-fries.JPG&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Served up in a big styrofoam plate lunch container, these fries delivered. The portion size felt generous. The fries were classic McDonalds-style, thin and crispy. The chili was decent, and there was enough applied to saturate all the fries without it getting soupy. The cheese was a real plus, finely grated and melted to various degrees, and topped with some chopped green onions. Frankly, that made the dish. The fries and meat were seasoned adequately, and the whole thing really came&amp;nbsp;together quite well. When I get in the mood for chili cheese fries,&amp;nbsp;when I remember that&amp;nbsp;taste from summers way back as a kid — well this is pretty much that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;On the other hand —&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit; font-size: large;&#34;&gt;BURGER FI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;This is a national chain with a location close to where I live. I was working near home one day when I got that craving again, having recently been to Melters, so I floated by to see what these guys could offer. My son is gluten allergic, so I keep an eye out for dining out options close to home. Burger Fi doesn&amp;rsquo;t have chili cheese fries on the menu per se, and maybe that says something, but you can get both cheese and chili as add-ons for your fries. I got a large fries with chili and cheese to go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;This is what I got.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HPtBSLfkwAE/U3kf1WJTkXI/AAAAAAAAAYk/kb5yXQsFZFs/s1600/IMG_0544.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HPtBSLfkwAE/U3kf1WJTkXI/AAAAAAAAAYk/kb5yXQsFZFs/s1600/IMG_0544.jpg&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;First of all, WTF?

Nauseating. Yeah, I pretty much knew what I was in for at that point. But I felt like they were personally challenging me, so I pressed on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9qkfiWxxZto/U3kf1so7zTI/AAAAAAAAAY8/X0RukvzU7ug/s1600/IMG_0545.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9qkfiWxxZto/U3kf1so7zTI/AAAAAAAAAY8/X0RukvzU7ug/s1600/IMG_0545.JPG&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;The fries. They were greasy, but it looked like most of that had been soaked up by the bag. They had that soft, thick-cut feel that a lot&amp;nbsp;of folks like. I&amp;nbsp;don&amp;rsquo;t mind thick-cut fries, I guess, but I generally prefer the more traditional kind. They tasted ok, I guess. Maybe a little over salted.&amp;nbsp;They sat heavy on the stomach. That feeling did not fully register until a few hours later, I can tell you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;I propped the little paper tray of fries on top of the bag, and cautiously began to assemble the ingredients. I had to do half at first, and then the other half later. Although it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like much at first, they did manage to cover almost all of the fries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tgeofYTvDyU/U3kf1tW6vUI/AAAAAAAAAY4/zO2Q0QOwO6A/s1600/IMG_0546.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tgeofYTvDyU/U3kf1tW6vUI/AAAAAAAAAY4/zO2Q0QOwO6A/s1600/IMG_0546.JPG&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Oh yeah, I had&amp;nbsp;jalapeños, too, which I plan to get next time I&amp;rsquo;m at Melters. I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to go back to Burger Fi. The chili and cheese were straight up food service issue. The cheese in particular was that kind of nacho cheese that you get at old gas stations. The&amp;nbsp;jalapeños were fresh, though. (If you notice a little accent mark over the n in&amp;nbsp;jalapeño, that&amp;rsquo;s the auto-correct doing that. I doubt I&amp;rsquo;d take the time.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;So yeah, I finished up, to my great shame. But on the plus side, I managed not to spill a drop of grease, cheese, or chili on my shirt, so I am proud of that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aJDYQSfOoTA/U3kf2F4akFI/AAAAAAAAAZA/cWscQldMz6Y/s1600/IMG_0547.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aJDYQSfOoTA/U3kf2F4akFI/AAAAAAAAAZA/cWscQldMz6Y/s1600/IMG_0547.jpg&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;In the picture there&amp;rsquo;s a little triangular mark in the lower left corner of my shirt, but that&amp;rsquo;s just the cracked lens of my iPhone.

Felt like I had eaten a brick. That kind&amp;nbsp;of feeling that makes you swear off forever of whatever it was you just had. And so I did. And I haven&amp;rsquo;t had chili cheese fries since. Thanks a lot, Burger Fi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;I once watched The Road to Wellville with Matthew Broderick and Anthony Hopkins, and I stopped watching movies for a long time after that. Burger Fi is like The Road to Wellville of chili cheese stuff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit; font-size: large;&#34;&gt;FINAL JUDGEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Melters, hands down. Burger Fi can go eat a greasy bag full of their own chili cheese fries for all I care. I&amp;rsquo;ll never be back. This was an easy decision, like a choice between a thing that is very good and a thing that is&amp;nbsp;quite awful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;This is an older review from TheVCubeSolver and I very much inspired by the hijinks of Brian Hammons and the gang over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;Review the World&lt;/a&gt;. In it we take a look at a couple of different varieties of Taki&amp;rsquo;s chips and some cane sugar soda pops we picked up at the local coffee shop.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Oh, and you&amp;rsquo;ll notice I&amp;rsquo;m calling myself &amp;ldquo;Meeks, the Pedestrian&amp;rdquo;. Cause we were trying to have code names or something. Never stuck. Leonard Mead is the main character from Ray Bradbury&amp;rsquo;s short story The Pedestrian. Leonard Meeks is an actual guy, and I got the names confused somehow. Cause I suck.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/0luO86BwwUo&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Go back, right now, and take a look at my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/02/zyka-indian-food-review.html&#34;&gt;Zyka India Food restaurant review&lt;/a&gt;. Notice anything suspicious about the Chicken 65? Take a closer look at those ingredients.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kOWZdp1hKUM/Uw7fZHHQ_MI/AAAAAAAAASo/PaKzZurs9tA/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-27+at+12.45.36+AM.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kOWZdp1hKUM/Uw7fZHHQ_MI/AAAAAAAAASo/PaKzZurs9tA/s400/Screen+Shot+2014-02-27+at+12.45.36+AM.png&#34; height=&#34;356&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Jalapenos. Onions. Cilantro. Sound familiar?   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re from Texas or anywhere in the Southwest you would immediately associate that combination with Mexican or Tex-Mex cuisine. There are other similarities, too, like the general spiciness, the use of chilis, or the penchant for using circular flatbread at every meal to sandwich ingredients and sop up sauces.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;This was recognized by my Indian friends, too. They told me about a legend they had that back a long, long time ago some Indian king had succeeded in tunneling through the earth, and wound up in Mexico. As the story goes, he then primarily used this tunnel to share recipes with the folks he found on the other side of the earth (Something like that. The details are sketchy at this point.) And that, son, is why peppers are eaten in both Mexico and India.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;I recall thinking to myself that this could work — not the tunnel thing, but that you could tweak the flavors and ingredients of Mexican cuisine to give it an Indian flare, and that (according to my calculations) the result should rock. So I filed my million dollar idea on the shelf next to all the others and quickly forgot about it. That was 10 years ago. Well, while I was sleeping somebody was raiding the shelf.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Enter Taco Naan.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s1FCfqq7-us/Uw7ftS5FUzI/AAAAAAAAASw/6I8C4JytHmY/s1600/images.jpeg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-s1FCfqq7-us/Uw7ftS5FUzI/AAAAAAAAASw/6I8C4JytHmY/s400/images.jpeg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Located in Coppell, Texas, Taco Naan is the realization of my old dream. I first ran across it while scouting a nearby geocache. The storefront is pretty unassuming — even verging on the dive-y. My geocaching buddy Jambone was hesitant to step in to the place, but I didn’t think it looked that bad. I’ve certainly had good food at worse looking places. Still, it gave the overall impression of a newish restaurant gone a little to seed. Once inside I noticed a back door behind the register that opened directly into the alley, which reinforced the impression that the building itself was cheaply constructed, one of those steel frame boxes that people like to turn into pre-fab houses for a few thousand bucks.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coppellstudentmedia.com/2013/10/24/taco-naan-brings-unique-flavor/&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZiGD7cVQXhU/Uw7gLThxA2I/AAAAAAAAAS4/4DwoMN8mQS8/s400/taco-naan-storefront-200x300.jpg&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; width=&#34;426&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;The seating area was small, but adequate for the business. I think there were two or three other people eating lunch. The register and menu stood opposite the entrance. Jambone and I walked up to place our orders. I was curious to get a look at what they offered, at the kinds of dishes and combinations they imagined.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Judge for yourself. Here’s the menu.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6oqomFPbORk/Uw7gamN8ssI/AAAAAAAAATA/hkNW1bUMqIs/s1600/DSC09308.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6oqomFPbORk/Uw7gamN8ssI/AAAAAAAAATA/hkNW1bUMqIs/s400/DSC09308.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3Dhd-o7nYC4/Uw7gcy33DQI/AAAAAAAAATI/jIX_XzsZmlk/s1600/DSC09309.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3Dhd-o7nYC4/Uw7gcy33DQI/AAAAAAAAATI/jIX_XzsZmlk/s400/DSC09309.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;The slogan is apparently “Delicious Tacos in Town!”, which is (perhaps unintentionally) modest. I was disappointed on reading the menu that it was basically a pretty standard taco shop, with a few Indian influenced offerings. One item that immediately stood out to me on the menu was the Lengua Taco, which is beef tongue. This was a dish I am well familiar with, having grown up in South Louisiana. My dad makes an excellent beef tongue gravy that I fondly remember from childhood, though he and I were the only ones that ever ate it. I understand it’s popular with Hispanic cultures, too, so this is definitely one item that I was interested in trying. The Bagara Bowl seemed tasty, but it was more of a straight-up Indian dish and I wanted to get a real sense of the culinary fusion. In the end I asked for a recommendation from the helpful and courteous lady at the counter, and she suggested the daily special, the Chicken Naan taco, which I ordered with Chicken 65 and a side of rice and beans.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;While filling up my soda I noticed something like a buffet bar behind a counter overlooking the kitchen filled with Indian dishes of various sorts. Everything looked and smelled wonderful. By now my appetite was whetted, and Jambone and I shot the breeze while we waited for our orders to come up, which didn’t take long given the lack of crowds.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nXqWDUftc-A/Uw7glgN7nAI/AAAAAAAAATQ/2N5eNq_iuH0/s1600/IMG_4500.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nXqWDUftc-A/Uw7glgN7nAI/AAAAAAAAATQ/2N5eNq_iuH0/s400/IMG_4500.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Mine arrived first, and after removing the tin foil wrapper from my taco I studied the plate. I was a little disappointed. The naan bread appeared to be nothing more than a pita, and the large slice of tomato added to the impression that I was going to be eating a Mexified gyro. The rice looked clumpy and unevenly colored. The refried beans lacked the topping of shredded cheese shown in the pictures, and while they never look all that appetizing under the best of circumstances, these seemed particularly gloppish.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Undeterred, I dug in and was immediately surprised by how enjoyable the taco actually was. The naan bread, though very pita-like in appearance, tasted wholly different than that Greek flatbread. I was expecting chewy and doughy, and what I got was a soft, melt-in-your-mouth smooth dough that cut easily on the teeth, lightly toasted with a millimeter thick layer of buttery crust, just enough to give you that hint of toasty crunch in every bite. The meat was unimpressive by Zyka standards, just little pieces, but adequately proportioned and well seasoned. The flavor was all Indian. The “fusion” part came with the lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream that filled out the taco. It was enjoyable start to finish, and left me curious about their other taco options.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;The rice and beans, though, were a different story. I got the sides to try to augment the fusion quality of the meal, but I was greatly disappointed in the quality. They tasted no better than they looked. The rice was clumpy and gummy. The beans were bland and tasteless. Both were tepid, flavorless, and unappealing. Sad, too, because I’ve always held a plate of rice and beans to be the best indicator of the overall quality of any Mexican restaurant. These didn’t speak well of the place.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;So was it worth it?   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Absolutely. For five or six bucks I got a soda, a killer taco, and some lackluster sides. Disappointing as they were, I figured next time I could just skip the rice and beans, or better yet, try the Biryani. A couple of dishes still called to me, like the Taco Lengua. They place could use some sprucing up, maybe, and a bigger disappointment is the lack of imagination evident in the menu. It just doesn’t have enough of a fusion quality to it, in my opinion. The menu is something like 70% Mexican, 20% Indian, and maybe 10% truly “mixed”. Still, though, they have a winning idea. All the ingredients are there. They call themselves Taco Naan and they deliver on both the Taco and the Naan. And that’s a good start.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;I’ll be returning to Taco Naan, because if nothing else they count as the only fast food Indian place I can think of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Suncreek Park - More Than Meets The Eye</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Two weeks ago my wife told me about a new park she had discovered while killing time between a couple of the kids&amp;rsquo; classes.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6mnC4JYvcn0/UwWCzShf6HI/AAAAAAAAAPM/y2nUzVn5A88/s1600/Screen+Shot+2014-02-19+at+10.16.29+PM.png&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6mnC4JYvcn0/UwWCzShf6HI/AAAAAAAAAPM/y2nUzVn5A88/s400/Screen+Shot+2014-02-19+at+10.16.29+PM.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;While climbing an overpass she caught site of some paved trails just off the road that interested her enough to want to Google it later. The trails turned out to be part of Suncreek Park in Allen, Texas. The website claims Suncreek sports only four tenths of a mile of paved trails, so it&amp;rsquo;s not much for walking, hiking, or biking. It does sport some scenic views, though, as well as a handful of geocaching opportunities. One unexpected and mysterious feature deserves further exploration, as I will soon relate.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SZU1MT1JR-g/UwWFbERm3iI/AAAAAAAAAP0/2Wh-axySyxI/s1600/DSC09093.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SZU1MT1JR-g/UwWFbERm3iI/AAAAAAAAAP0/2Wh-axySyxI/s400/DSC09093.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;We had an opportunity to check out the park firsthand, so we made the trip up to Allen. When we got there we discovered a smallish playground with toddler (and dog) friendly equipment. The baby particularly enjoyed little chair shaped like a car that sat on a big spring and wobbled him back and forth.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-es6X3FBXIWA/UwWECafmR2I/AAAAAAAAAPc/_FyqqfEYTPI/s1600/DSC09091.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-es6X3FBXIWA/UwWECafmR2I/AAAAAAAAAPc/_FyqqfEYTPI/s400/DSC09091.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Since no one else was there, Frank the Dog got to enjoy the kiddie slides, but balked at some of the larger ones. It was funny watching him try to scoot back up the biggest of them after chickening out halfway. The playground sits next to a couple of large decks with seating and table areas overlooking a miniature wetland of sorts. Unfortunately close to the deck I spotted a few pieces litter that detracted from the natural scenery. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame that garbage lines so many of our creeks and waterways. Perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s the case in any large city, but I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TqVb-dHCgFU/UwWExDYzazI/AAAAAAAAAPk/8RuwZFJi1vY/s1600/DSC09040.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TqVb-dHCgFU/UwWExDYzazI/AAAAAAAAAPk/8RuwZFJi1vY/s400/DSC09040.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;The playground also serves as a trailhead, so we started out from that point. South of us a couple of guys standing in a large field were trying to get their remote control drone to work, but I never saw it lift off the ground. Just a little farther along the trail forked off into a small patch of woods. We decided to investigate.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-awfiHRbUG8U/UwWDwvMobiI/AAAAAAAAAPU/FgaUExXRm-E/s1600/DSC09004.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-awfiHRbUG8U/UwWDwvMobiI/AAAAAAAAAPU/FgaUExXRm-E/s400/DSC09004.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;The paths were wide and well maintained. The trail was clear of brush and debris for several feet on either side.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tvQ_3E_RJds/UwWE7koU7GI/AAAAAAAAAPs/8CNZD0qDg3s/s1600/DSC09010.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tvQ_3E_RJds/UwWE7koU7GI/AAAAAAAAAPs/8CNZD0qDg3s/s400/DSC09010.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;A new fork in the trail led to an abandoned bridge, beyond which appeared to lie the private property of some working farm.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mrsnWBgAuz0/UwWGGQXHgRI/AAAAAAAAAQA/yIupWoibum0/s1600/DSC09005.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mrsnWBgAuz0/UwWGGQXHgRI/AAAAAAAAAQA/yIupWoibum0/s400/DSC09005.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;On the other side of the trail an old road, now inaccessible by car, ran straight north to the borders of the park. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of daylight available to us, so I passed up a geocaching opportunity on this end of the park in favor of a easier grab later on.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jj6teBPp3yQ/UwWGQ-f-07I/AAAAAAAAAQI/qfVOZoQwZVE/s1600/DSC09016.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jj6teBPp3yQ/UwWGQ-f-07I/AAAAAAAAAQI/qfVOZoQwZVE/s400/DSC09016.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;It was around this area that we ran into a couple of curious signs. One warned us not to trespass on private property. (Then why does this public park lead right through it?) The other announced that we were entering &amp;ldquo;The Gardens of Connemara&amp;rdquo;, like something out of a Conan novel. As the sign explained, the gardens are a private nature conservancy accessible from the park, but not part of it. Since we saw no gate, it was unclear whether there are parts of the gardens accessible to the public, or if we hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet entered the gardens.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_v3Ur933aKs/UwWGsi0PWyI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/iqCwWbuzMiA/s1600/DSC09023.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_v3Ur933aKs/UwWGsi0PWyI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/iqCwWbuzMiA/s400/DSC09023.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;At any rate, the sign said no dogs, so we turned around rather than have to face the hassle of getting booted. No matter. It looked interesting enough, so I made the decision to come back another day. Later I learned that you can buy a membership for the privilege of visiting the garden at any time. Otherwise they offer guided tours to the public at posted times.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sLQ7Ie9pTNo/UwWG0yutLoI/AAAAAAAAAQY/xG7JhHPK3vs/s1600/DSC09029.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sLQ7Ie9pTNo/UwWG0yutLoI/AAAAAAAAAQY/xG7JhHPK3vs/s400/DSC09029.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;It was a coolish evening, but the direct sunlight warmed you up. It was about that time that the baby decided to toss the hat and blanket, which led to a direct confrontation with Mom. Baby won that fight.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Bqvl-GKTYDs/UwWHANVQ1UI/AAAAAAAAAQg/p8ie5HPrqac/s1600/DSC09053.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Bqvl-GKTYDs/UwWHANVQ1UI/AAAAAAAAAQg/p8ie5HPrqac/s400/DSC09053.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;We passed under the overpass where I spotted more of Dallas&amp;rsquo;s famous positive graffiti. This time it was a golden cross. I tried to focus the kids&amp;rsquo; attention on that, rather than the &amp;ldquo;Fuck Suparman&amp;rdquo; invective scrawled on the concrete ramp opposite.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-naADk_s6sow/UwWHNMWIgwI/AAAAAAAAAQo/z7hfs_2d8YM/s1600/DSC09056.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-naADk_s6sow/UwWHNMWIgwI/AAAAAAAAAQo/z7hfs_2d8YM/s400/DSC09056.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Round the corner the path wound through a small grove of trees. It was beautiful and kind of striking in the evening light. The denuded trees seemed still and quiet, and the thinnest gray haze, barely perceptible, hung in the air at the far end of the path.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Dxpvpbp1zGo/UwWHT6auI6I/AAAAAAAAAQw/NZhdkdeKz2A/s1600/DSC09068.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Dxpvpbp1zGo/UwWHT6auI6I/AAAAAAAAAQw/NZhdkdeKz2A/s400/DSC09068.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;There a couple of tall trees arced over the entrance to the now darkened woods. Something about watching Augie and Lucy contemplate the dark forest path brought to mind the story of Hansel and Gretel.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AHDuZ4JMcA8/UwWHiPxRIPI/AAAAAAAAARI/GTSH5TOCYxs/s1600/DSC09073.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AHDuZ4JMcA8/UwWHiPxRIPI/AAAAAAAAARI/GTSH5TOCYxs/s400/DSC09073.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;My first geocaching opportunity came a short ways into the woods, after the paved sidewalk ended and was replaced by a dirt trail that roughly paralleled a creek off to our left. The cache was a traditional ammo can-type hide, nothing too difficult to spot. It was located about 15 yards off the path, stuffed in an old hollowed out log and sparsely covered with a few branches.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-260soxhMl8E/UwWHu9eQKxI/AAAAAAAAARQ/hPlA5GtYqW0/s1600/IMG_4373.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-260soxhMl8E/UwWHu9eQKxI/AAAAAAAAARQ/hPlA5GtYqW0/s400/IMG_4373.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything of much value, but at least the contents and log book were dry. Augie and I signed the log book and I left a few decorative bottle caps and some fall decorations in place of the trinkets Lucy took. I forget now what that was.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iXJRqCA5oPo/UwWH7AoaphI/AAAAAAAAARY/FlpT4Puu2ao/s1600/DSC09072.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iXJRqCA5oPo/UwWH7AoaphI/AAAAAAAAARY/FlpT4Puu2ao/s400/DSC09072.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;While I was loading up the cache with swag from my packback, we began to hear some loud voices and yelling from farther up the trail. Kassi, who had gone ahead with the baby, began calling to us in an alarmed tone. We packed up and marched over to her position, where I could see that a group of teenagers were out screwing around in the woods. They didn&amp;rsquo;t look too threatening to me, but with the recent murder fresh in mind, Kassi was a little wary. We decided to take a different branch of the trail that seemed to loop around them.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7sIlzOa7vMQ/UwWITS0bXfI/AAAAAAAAARg/xiNeiUBS6B4/s1600/DSC09077.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7sIlzOa7vMQ/UwWITS0bXfI/AAAAAAAAARg/xiNeiUBS6B4/s400/DSC09077.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;The trail narrowed, and the tacky soil was making conditions a little rough for the stroller. Still, we had managed worse terrain before.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aw62_GSSA3o/UwWIrFd0lDI/AAAAAAAAARs/K96CKpiyswI/s1600/DSC09076.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aw62_GSSA3o/UwWIrFd0lDI/AAAAAAAAARs/K96CKpiyswI/s400/DSC09076.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;We pushed ahead until we arrived at a washed out bridge, and I could see that the teens from earlier had either walked over to this spot, or we were looking at a different group of kids. We could see that there were paved trails on the opposite side of the creek, and our goal was to try to find a crossing. Looking at Google Maps, it appeared that the creek ended just north of us at a small pool, where we could theoretically round the northern end to get to the other side of the creek. To do that it looked to me like we&amp;rsquo;d have to go cross-country. Kassi thought that the trails would eventually lead us there, and we had a disagreement over the course to take. At any rate it was getting darker and the sketchy kids were making Kassi nervous, so we figured we&amp;rsquo;d best head back to the car. We had another disagreement over which path to take. Luckily I won out on that one, cause I was right! Ha.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JFBv00zpKEQ/UwWI-UC425I/AAAAAAAAAR0/23nHM_EDpME/s1600/DSC09048.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JFBv00zpKEQ/UwWI-UC425I/AAAAAAAAAR0/23nHM_EDpME/s400/DSC09048.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;For a small park with only a limited amount of paved walking trails, Suncreek left me feeling that we had only only scratched the surface of its possibilities. A return trip is definitely in order. There is a separate system of trails south of where we parked that apparently do not link up with the ones we were on. Also, I&amp;rsquo;d like to see what secrets the Gardens of Connemara have to offer, especially come spring.    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Jy-sp6IzDko/UwWJDYEXIUI/AAAAAAAAAR8/SeMvJWEIWqs/s1600/DSC09086.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Jy-sp6IzDko/UwWJDYEXIUI/AAAAAAAAAR8/SeMvJWEIWqs/s400/DSC09086.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: inherit;&#34;&gt;Back in the summer of 2013 TheVCubeSolver and I dropped by the local candy shop to review &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bluebunny.com/Products/d/Jolly_Rancher_Cool_Tubes&#34;&gt;Blue Bunny&amp;rsquo;s Jolly Rancher Cool Tubes&lt;/a&gt;, a push-pop like product in three weird flavors. It turned out to be a complete and total sensory experience.  &lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/6oEA207lVsc&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
