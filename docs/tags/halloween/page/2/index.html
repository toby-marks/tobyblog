      From a respectful write-up on Texas Frightmare Weekend by Dread Central:
Can we stop calling Texas Frightmare Weekend a “regional con” now? The first reader I met this year was Aaron from Australia, who had flown all the way here to experience TFW as his FIRST con.
I met that guy! Twice. Sat right next to him at the special 35mm screening of Phantasm at the Alamo Draft House in Richardson.

      Dr. Channard from Hellraiser II, in all his gloryCollector's Crypt is a boutique shop in Dallas specializing in horror and sci-fi collectibles, memorabilia, paraphernalia, and… well, you just gotta see it, folks. It's an amazing place. I discovered them only recently after attending the St. Patrick's Slay Weekend event at Dark Hour Haunted House in Plano. They were a sponsor of that particular show, so Dark Hour graciously gave them some floor space to sell a few wares after the show and otherwise promote the store.

      Would you like to win this original 8 x 10 photograph that hung in our house this past Halloween? It&rsquo;s a portrait inspired by my all-time favorite Halloween blog, The Skull and Pumpkin of Mike Cathcart&rsquo;s. The updates have been spotty over these past few years, but the back content is well worth discovering for yourself. If you do take a look, be sure to leave a comment in appreciation.

      I love Halloween. You do, too. This video is a tribute to that season, to every memory and every thrill. To cold autumn nights. To the warm glow of jack o&rsquo; lanterns. To spooky stories and cozy evenings. To every bit of magic and adventure in our lives. This is the story of Halloween 2013 as we experienced it; what has gone down in our lives and memories as THE BEST HALLOWEEN EVER.

  <p>
    
      Already a great place to find exotic candies, foreign soda pop, and specialty food items at any time of the year (Brian Hammons, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about), World Market really comes alive for Halloween. If you&rsquo;ve got one in your area, get down there right now and check their selection. The stuff they carry is definitely outside of the Target/Big Lots/Dollar Store Halloween mold, but that&rsquo;s not to say it&rsquo;s super expensive.

      Here you go, folks, the real star of Phantasm — that bad-ass muscle car! A real thing of beauty, and I&rsquo;m not even that much of a car guy.

      HALLOWEEN LOVERS EVERYWHERE, IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THE LEMAX SPOOKY TOWN COLLECTION AT MICHAELS, FIND ONE NEAR YOU AND GO THERE.&nbsp;NOW.

I am not kidding.
I discovered the world of Lemax Village collectibles only a year ago. They also make Christmas sets, but the Halloween village is sold exclusively at Michaels. Now I&rsquo;m not normally the kind of guy that goes gaga for stuff like this, but the artistry and imagination evident in these pieces is hard to deny.

      Greetings, friends! It&rsquo;s been a few days since my last update, but I haven&rsquo;t been idle. Have you noticed how early the stores are stocking for Halloween this year? I blogged about my first sighting at At Home&nbsp;(formerly Garden Ridge)&nbsp;which was on July 1st, a full one month earlier than last year. (And if you&rsquo;re interested, that was at a chain called Home Goods, where the theme of ravens &amp; blackbirds predominated.

  <p>
    
      Yesterday Yankee Candle had a special one-day preview of their upcoming Halloween 2014 collection, and we dropped in to get a look. Thanks to @PerkyJewels #FF for the tip-off!


Tragically, most of the "Bonies" decorations were sold out by the time we got there. We were told by staff that most of the merchandise was gone within the first half-hour of the store opening, so that should show you the amazing pent-up demand for Halloween this year.
