  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/fLk7N04OQ5E&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hello again, folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while now since I&amp;rsquo;ve been active on this site, but life has not held still for me and the family. Since the last time I posted anything of significance, quite a great deal has happened, actually, much of which was originally destined for publication here. Well, as it does, life got in the way, priorities shifted, my free time diminished, etc. etc. — and the gist of it all is that you folks were left unattended for many months.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, my hope is to change that situation, especially as we draw nearer to that weird season both blessed and profane, which has become so dear to my heart over the last several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have things to show you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you will indulge me if quite a few of those things involve a short trip back in time to catch you up on all the adventures of the past year. They will be new experiences to you, at any rate, though they might necessarily arrive just a bit out of season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better late than never, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to today&amp;rsquo;s post. This June we were delighted to once again host our good friend Brian Hammons of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;ReviewTheWorld.com&lt;/a&gt; as he made his long-awaited return trip to Dallas. The story of that visit is worth a blog in itself. Needless to say, some hot summer fun, fresh eats, and review-worthy times were had by all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what better way to commemorate that occasion than by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/04/skittles-four-ways.html&#34;&gt;revisiting one of my favorite joint-review projects&lt;/a&gt; with Augie and Brian, the now traditional Skittles multi-way review, in which we launch into some new seasonal varieties promising plenty of explosive and sometimes oddball candy flavors. First up — America Skittles, filmed in plenty of time for Independence Day celebrations, but only released today, with fall peeking around the corner. Such is life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, it&amp;rsquo;s good to be back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year again folks, that magical time between Christmas and New Year where thoughtful commentators like myself come out with their end of year retrospectives; and continuing a tradition I established a couple of years back on this site, I intend to give you my take on the best of my buddy Brian Hammons&amp;rsquo; output over on the internet&amp;rsquo;s most beloved nostalgia blog, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;ReviewTheWorld.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can catch up on previous years&amp;rsquo; content by taking a look at my other lists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/top-10-review-the-world-episodes-of-2013/&#34;&gt;Top 10 Review the World Episodes of 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/top-10-review-the-world-episodes-of-2014/&#34;&gt;Top 10 Review the World Episodes of 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s get into it. Here are my pics for the top 10 episodes of the 2015-2016 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-rtw-makes-dark-outries-snack-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2016-06-rtw-makes-dark-outries-snack-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2016/06/rtw-makes-dark-outries-snack.html&#34;&gt;#10: RtW Makes &amp;ldquo;Dark Outries&amp;rdquo; Snack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvLbS7Erwo4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian and Carolina buddies DJD of &lt;a href=&#34;http://darkentriesgothradio.podbean.com/&#34;&gt;Dark Entries Goth Radio&lt;/a&gt; and Will of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.casseroleofdisaster.com/&#34;&gt;CasseroleOfDisaster.com&lt;/a&gt; come up with a supposedly tasty little hors d&amp;rsquo;oeuvre dish as they kick back in the CoD HQ and prepare for a weekend retro nerd debauchery. Have you made your Dark Outries yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you even know what a Dark Outrie is yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;9-texas-taco-challenge-taco-naan-vs-fuel-city-taco-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2015-03-texas-taco-challenge-taco-naan-vs-fuel-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/03/texas-taco-challenge-taco-naan-vs-fuel.html&#34;&gt;#9: Texas Taco Challenge: Taco Naan vs. Fuel City Taco&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEDVIb79Q3k&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you know? I happen to guest star in this one, along with TheVCubeSolver, who (I realize now) has grown an amazing amount since this vid was filmed. The time goes by so fast, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? This was a fun couple of spots to film and features some of my favorite DFW cuisine. And I know Brian enjoyed the hell out of this one, as he has not stopped mentioning Fuel City to this day. Just watching makes me hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;8-snapple-fall-spice-tea-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2016-09-snapple-fall-spice-tea-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2016/09/snapple-fall-spice-tea.html&#34;&gt;#8: Snapple Fall Spice Tea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nEwk8NVcLbM&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trees are budding out, the birds are singing, but Brian and Nick are reviewing this fall flavor that reminds you of your grandma&amp;rsquo;s toilet. A dud of a flavor, but some very cool outdoor scenery makes you crave that feeling of early spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-guide-to-goosebumps-2-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2015-08-guide-to-goosebumps-2-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/08/guide-to-goosebumps-2.html&#34;&gt;#7: Guide to Goosebumps #2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only written blog article included in our list, this second installment of the Guide to Goosebumps series sees Brian and I hitting our stride and reviewing some of our most iconic episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-pringles-hot-diggity-dog-chips-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2016-05-pringles-hot-diggity-dog-chips-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2016/05/pringles-hot-diggity-dog-chips.html&#34;&gt;6: Pringles Hot Diggity Dog Chips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PyA7XF-o268&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian and Nick do some serious walking and talking around the old neighborhood trying to decipher this Weiner-colored can full of mustard-y Pringles. A solid and classic Brian-and-Nick review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-kool-aid-great-bluedini-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2015-07-kool-aid-great-bluedini-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/07/kool-aid-great-bluedini.html&#34;&gt;#5: Kool-Aid Great Bluedini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jw6zzOhJRQQ&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the true highlights of the 2015 season, this energetic and spirited review overflows with nostalgic goodness, as Brian tackles one of his favorite 90s Kool Aid flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-original-new-york-seltzer-sodas-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2016-04-original-new-york-seltzer-sodas-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2016/04/original-new-york-seltzer-sodas.html&#34;&gt;#4: Original New York Seltzer Sodas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydAjERM4oxI&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the year of the Crystal Pepsi revival, Brian filmed a rare epic-length review covering five flavors of Original New York Seltzer sodas, all sent to him by yours truly. The beautiful Hamiltonian outdoor scenery as well as Brian and Nick&amp;rsquo;s unique takes on these surprising flavors makes this one a must see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-angilo-s-pizza-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2015-11-angilos-pizza-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/11/angilos-pizza.html&#34;&gt;#3: Angilo&amp;rsquo;s Pizza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/u9ftSETyLAY&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restaurant reviews are unfortunately pretty rare these days on RtW, so this sit down food review was a welcome change of pace, covering some genuinely tasty looking eats and a bit of RtW history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-jones-soda-2015-easter-flavors-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2015-04-jones-soda-2015-easter-flavors-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/04/jones-soda-2015-easter-flavors.html&#34;&gt;#2: Jones Soda 2015 Easter Flavors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KyuRCycg9s&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first video review from Hamilton of 2015, this one features some electric Easter sodas and some even higher energy reviewing, as Nick and Brian deliver an exhilarating return to form in the new year. They still got it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-onys-seltzer-sodas-the-sequel-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2016-05-onys-seltzer-sodas-sequel-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2016/05/onys-seltzer-sodas-sequel.html&#34;&gt;#1: ONYS Seltzer Sodas: The Sequel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vcE2pMOsad8&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what might be one of the best, funniest, and most energized Nick and Brian reviews of all time, the boys cover three additional flavors they missed from the ONYS lineup, delivered to them straight from corporate HQ! In return, the boys deliver an honest but enthusiastic review with Hamilton urban scenery as a backdrop. You can&amp;rsquo;t wait to find out what&amp;rsquo;s next in this one, and what these guys are gonna think about it. Very compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you guys enjoy, and check out the back catalog over on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;reviewtheworld.com&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Dark Hour - Best Haunt Ever!</title>

        <description>&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2FRIs6Ct-Fc/VgDXNDwW06I/AAAAAAAACcY/NajCMB6v3Rc/s1600/DH17.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;424&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2FRIs6Ct-Fc/VgDXNDwW06I/AAAAAAAACcY/NajCMB6v3Rc/s640/DH17.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered The Dark Hour in March, at St. Patrick&#39;s Day of all times, and I fell in love. I don&#39;t have the skills to work there, but I think if I could just secretly sneak in and live there, I would. I&#39;d be like that weird guy from the movies who lives between the walls somehow, and you hear him rummaging around in the fridge at night. Just hope I don&#39;t get caught! Cause you know, awkward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cCy4s8Pmkrg/VgDXJAS7EbI/AAAAAAAACks/YtumO0Fl8uM/s1600/DH10.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cCy4s8Pmkrg/VgDXJAS7EbI/AAAAAAAACks/YtumO0Fl8uM/s320/DH10.jpg&#34; width=&#34;240&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jMOcDoTcNpk/VgDXMGifNwI/AAAAAAAACcI/IX6-7oksodE/s1600/DH13.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jMOcDoTcNpk/VgDXMGifNwI/AAAAAAAACcI/IX6-7oksodE/s400/DH13.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VtAojDLP8Rw/VgDXKDRawiI/AAAAAAAACkw/LLWGyAQaIqY/s1600/DH102.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;426&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VtAojDLP8Rw/VgDXKDRawiI/AAAAAAAACkw/LLWGyAQaIqY/s640/DH102.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark Hour is a haunted house in Plano, Texas. It is one of the premier haunted houses in the nation, in fact — open year round, with shows every month aside from August and November. No show in August, because it takes extra time to prepare for the BIG show in September/October. (And by the way I AM SO EXCITED for the big show!) And no show in November because they&#39;re recovering from October; that&#39;s how much they throw themselves into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jTV9NjDBmXk/VgDXZKmfIbI/AAAAAAAACf4/TRCGxhLsTDw/s1600/DH5.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jTV9NjDBmXk/VgDXZKmfIbI/AAAAAAAACf4/TRCGxhLsTDw/s400/DH5.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W2lUE99509g/VgDXOSSApoI/AAAAAAAACcs/RhMKOwQ2OCc/s1600/DH2.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W2lUE99509g/VgDXOSSApoI/AAAAAAAACcs/RhMKOwQ2OCc/s640/DH2.jpg&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I refer to them personally as &#34;shows&#34; and not &#34;haunts&#34;, because to me it&#39;s Vegas-quality spectacle. You get sets, lights, costumes, makeup, story, acting, music, dancing — the whole shebang. Their level of professionalism, the attention to detail, is just awe-inspiring. These guys love what they do and they are proud of what they do, and it comes through in every aspect of their productions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5QaLrTUDXsE/VgDXUq3dHDI/AAAAAAAACe8/a8XxkfpWh4A/s1600/DH4.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5QaLrTUDXsE/VgDXUq3dHDI/AAAAAAAACe8/a8XxkfpWh4A/s640/DH4.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kbXCoRbdAHY/VgDXMwB2DCI/AAAAAAAACcc/ZjwlB9mMJUc/s1600/DH16.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kbXCoRbdAHY/VgDXMwB2DCI/AAAAAAAACcc/ZjwlB9mMJUc/s400/DH16.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an example from a recent show, at the Summer Spirits event TheVCubeSolver and I were wending our way through the roughly 30,000 foot &#34;path&#34; that takes you through the three distinct sections of the haunt - the Dominion of the Dead, Coven Manor, and Voodoo Vengeance, when we passed through a kind of kitchen pantry area leading to a cafeteria lunch line filled full of some pretty gross stuff. As I scanned the scene my eyes settled upon a shelf lined with Calumet baking powder, an obscure reference to The Shining that I only caught because I had recently watched the documentary Room 237! That kind of blew me away, that somebody would go to that much trouble to incorporate such a minor, but incredibly satisfying little detail for folks &#34;in the know&#34;. These guys not only know their craft, but their audience as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nB1FCXhbNZ8/VgDXO3ju0dI/AAAAAAAACk8/M0DuCQlpJLs/s1600/DH21.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nB1FCXhbNZ8/VgDXO3ju0dI/AAAAAAAACk8/M0DuCQlpJLs/s640/DH21.jpg&#34; width=&#34;424&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3GWqPXS5Rvo/VgDXPs-wyBI/AAAAAAAACk8/1y4OWmacyfY/s1600/DH24.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;426&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3GWqPXS5Rvo/VgDXPs-wyBI/AAAAAAAACk8/1y4OWmacyfY/s640/DH24.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-daU0RmVLSPg/VgDXNih5lKI/AAAAAAAACc8/L6ndo80dFuc/s1600/DH18.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;426&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-daU0RmVLSPg/VgDXNih5lKI/AAAAAAAACc8/L6ndo80dFuc/s640/DH18.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered Dark Hour almost by chance, while Googling for something interesting to do while my friend Brian from &lt;a href=&#34;http://reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;reviewtheworld.com&lt;/a&gt; was in town from Ohio. When I found out there was a haunted house open that weekend it seemed like a no-brainer. Little did I expect, though, a haunt on the scale of Dark Hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2oEE_BbePuM/VgDXVKyKVqI/AAAAAAAACeo/N10S3uZtn4s/s1600/DH41.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;213&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2oEE_BbePuM/VgDXVKyKVqI/AAAAAAAACeo/N10S3uZtn4s/s320/DH41.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GO1NWzxn9TM/VgDXObar-LI/AAAAAAAACk8/WztA5O-HNO4/s1600/DH20.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;426&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GO1NWzxn9TM/VgDXObar-LI/AAAAAAAACk8/WztA5O-HNO4/s640/DH20.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as you enter the building it&#39;s a full-on sensory assault. The first thing you notice is this incredibly pungent aroma — like an overpowering dark incense or something. I have no idea what that scent is, but I remember hoping by the end of the night that it would seep into my clothes so I could take it home with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-shj_fspsCPE/VgDXR8dW6DI/AAAAAAAACk4/zh8gYR_ZUIA/s1600/DH31.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;425&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-shj_fspsCPE/VgDXR8dW6DI/AAAAAAAACk4/zh8gYR_ZUIA/s640/DH31.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-S9Z02Y22ksQ/VgDXQT6UZCI/AAAAAAAACk8/MnnUeW5fb4s/s1600/DH26.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;426&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-S9Z02Y22ksQ/VgDXQT6UZCI/AAAAAAAACk8/MnnUeW5fb4s/s640/DH26.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lights are the next thing you notice, because everything inside is done up like a Dario Argento flick. Although it&#39;s basically dark as a cave in the entrance (it takes your eyes a second to adjust), strong colored lights accent a few animatronic greeters in the lobby, all dominated by this amazing 20 foot golem that stands over a smoking cauldron. I thought I had stepped into a black magic Chuck E. Cheese. My first instinct was just to stand there and gawp at the thing, and on return visits when it wasn&#39;t too busy we&#39;ve loitered a bit at the front just to take a closer look at everything they have going on there. Turns out there are a lot of little details that contribute to the basic story of the haunt. It&#39;s really well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bSSZHAK2Mj8/VgDXLL-9cYI/AAAAAAAACkw/gs9nIlj-QAY/s1600/DH105.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bSSZHAK2Mj8/VgDXLL-9cYI/AAAAAAAACkw/gs9nIlj-QAY/s400/DH105.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EwnT8Hx_5hM/VgDXb_kvqXI/AAAAAAAACk4/CFk5gZaMsxc/s1600/DH56.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EwnT8Hx_5hM/VgDXb_kvqXI/AAAAAAAACk4/CFk5gZaMsxc/s400/DH56.jpg&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-53kYklsq720/VgDXcWgSxYI/AAAAAAAACk4/k48rldYPED8/s1600/DH57.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-53kYklsq720/VgDXcWgSxYI/AAAAAAAACk4/k48rldYPED8/s640/DH57.jpg&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Yd4PUssgLEs/VgDXhewLSRI/AAAAAAAACkw/puUwAVRVC0Q/s1600/DH70.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Yd4PUssgLEs/VgDXhewLSRI/AAAAAAAACkw/puUwAVRVC0Q/s400/DH70.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music is the next thing that hits you, and they like to switch that out from haunt to haunt, but it&#39;s never failed to bring a smile to my face. On occasion I&#39;ve caught some cool soundtrack stuff, like the unsettling synth of Italian prog-rock band Goblin. It was their theme music from Suspiria, that show about a girls&#39; boarding school secretly run by witches, that greeted you in the lobby the night of the aforementioned Summer Spirits show. A pitch-perfect nod right in the door that set the stage for what was to be a show crammed with movie and other fictional references.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Dhq163SoQRY/VgDXj91piEI/AAAAAAAACiQ/S-AzLjLrR5M/s1600/DH8.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Dhq163SoQRY/VgDXj91piEI/AAAAAAAACiQ/S-AzLjLrR5M/s640/DH8.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-72jOpcOrGAQ/VgDXTF6gMpI/AAAAAAAACeQ/RHbN1JJOxVA/s1600/DH36.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-72jOpcOrGAQ/VgDXTF6gMpI/AAAAAAAACeQ/RHbN1JJOxVA/s320/DH36.jpg&#34; width=&#34;213&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5G8UioxRKOI/VgDXT-MtWJI/AAAAAAAACk4/zPnRNYOfUmM/s1600/DH37.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5G8UioxRKOI/VgDXT-MtWJI/AAAAAAAACk4/zPnRNYOfUmM/s400/DH37.jpg&#34; width=&#34;266&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lGzFETJNQAM/VgDXUQnoJII/AAAAAAAACec/H6ct83tPPgM/s1600/DH39.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;266&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lGzFETJNQAM/VgDXUQnoJII/AAAAAAAACec/H6ct83tPPgM/s400/DH39.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-evEgofCEOEw/VgDXU7zRrYI/AAAAAAAACew/YHOMiwWBKpE/s1600/DH40.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;426&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-evEgofCEOEw/VgDXU7zRrYI/AAAAAAAACew/YHOMiwWBKpE/s640/DH40.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the lines are bigger you get actors roaming the lobby to harass (er, warm up) the visitors and pose for pictures. These guys range from the funny to the downright disturbing. They generally like to interact with you so it&#39;s a good opportunity to practice your role playing skills, if you have them. Or you can just snap surreptitious pics like you&#39;re on safari in the nut house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9LjTpIPvcu8/VgDXUHzy2MI/AAAAAAAACeY/yJgY3gtOFwQ/s1600/DH38.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;266&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9LjTpIPvcu8/VgDXUHzy2MI/AAAAAAAACeY/yJgY3gtOFwQ/s400/DH38.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ztngWeMcsnU/VgDXP8aSNaI/AAAAAAAACk8/SKMNVQivRRg/s1600/DH25.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ztngWeMcsnU/VgDXP8aSNaI/AAAAAAAACk8/SKMNVQivRRg/s400/DH25.jpg&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the really cool things about Dark Hour is that you generally get live entertainment while you wait in line. You can skip the long lines with a VIP pass, but for the life of me I don&#39;t know why anybody would want to. On one occasion I arrived a little early to shorter than usual lines and I was actually afraid I&#39;d miss the pre-show. By now I&#39;ve come to expect it as part of the warm-up. Occasionally they&#39;ll have live bands, which have always been great. From time to time you&#39;ll get dancers, and if you&#39;re REALLY lucky, Buddy Blood the singing vampire will come out and do his lounge act for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RdCqlQ7ARXY/VgDXS4ztbQI/AAAAAAAACk4/uU2BJHhgyYs/s1600/DH34.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;425&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RdCqlQ7ARXY/VgDXS4ztbQI/AAAAAAAACk4/uU2BJHhgyYs/s640/DH34.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vs7rI9ZmpBU&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kU38YajA-_E/VgDXgA1eaNI/AAAAAAAACkw/M8P7Lfc4mGQ/s1600/DH67.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kU38YajA-_E/VgDXgA1eaNI/AAAAAAAACkw/M8P7Lfc4mGQ/s640/DH67.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7jruePfUa6M/VgDXga8mc2I/AAAAAAAACkw/3Zx6hnYhkJU/s1600/DH68.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7jruePfUa6M/VgDXga8mc2I/AAAAAAAACkw/3Zx6hnYhkJU/s640/DH68.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5HUHjh2cvzY&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KWEfZNkAnzA/VgDXic-9YPI/AAAAAAAACkw/1Euak3OoJtI/s1600/DH73.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KWEfZNkAnzA/VgDXic-9YPI/AAAAAAAACkw/1Euak3OoJtI/s640/DH73.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are not allowed to take pictures inside the haunt, which would be both ridiculous and impractical. Still, though, I wish I could because there is so much on the inside worth capturing. The set design takes your breath away in places, like at the entrance to Voodoo Vengeance. You&#39;re encouraged to move along at a reasonable pace but sometimes you just want to stop and take it all in. I have sometimes wondered what I look like to the monsters as I stumble through the haunt, mouth agape and occasionally turning the wrong way or running into things. Then they did this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hszYgS8GRJ0&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re the first guys featured in the scare cam! There I am, captured on camera, shoving TheVCubeSolver into the arms of a monster as I make a speedy exit from the room. I try to be a good father, and the monsters appreciate that. Once I made one of the actors break character just enough to laugh at me and yell &#34;World&#39;s Greatest Father!&#34; after I came close to jabbing my son in the eye with a glow stick after overreacting to a jump scare. My fault? I say it was a good show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2o3-ShW54cQ/VgDXhqjF35I/AAAAAAAACkw/PcWC9nVlqcY/s1600/DH72.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2o3-ShW54cQ/VgDXhqjF35I/AAAAAAAACkw/PcWC9nVlqcY/s640/DH72.jpg&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UiLxhGgLiaM/VgDXkF6GujI/AAAAAAAACiU/pqgdfk904ZY/s1600/DH80.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UiLxhGgLiaM/VgDXkF6GujI/AAAAAAAACiU/pqgdfk904ZY/s400/DH80.jpg&#34; width=&#34;258&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u7-MrbUda2c/VgDXkefqfII/AAAAAAAACic/JX2X3LqDjZA/s1600/DH81.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u7-MrbUda2c/VgDXkefqfII/AAAAAAAACic/JX2X3LqDjZA/s640/DH81.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Vip6eFIt9RM/VgDXiiNvJ5I/AAAAAAAACkw/hn_9qLUOqUI/s1600/DH75.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Vip6eFIt9RM/VgDXiiNvJ5I/AAAAAAAACkw/hn_9qLUOqUI/s640/DH75.jpg&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark Hour puts on several shows connected by a common storyline. The story arch is flexible enough to allow them to change things up a bit from production to production, but the extent to which each year&#39;s shows vary is still being worked out.

Walpurgisnacht had a dark art gallery, Dog Days had a catered BBQ dinner, and Summer Spirits even had a prom night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-e_Kqr_2l-Ts/VgDXmnHki9I/AAAAAAAACkw/Ht__lWc_vaE/s1600/DH86.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-e_Kqr_2l-Ts/VgDXmnHki9I/AAAAAAAACkw/Ht__lWc_vaE/s640/DH86.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cebB8yHXbhc/VgDXpAUrfnI/AAAAAAAACkc/Q4nfEegKF3U/s1600/DH91.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cebB8yHXbhc/VgDXpAUrfnI/AAAAAAAACkc/Q4nfEegKF3U/s640/DH91.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GdcsWPRRnAo/VgDXrNG7c8I/AAAAAAAACkE/wzme50JNHBI/s1600/DH96.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;426&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GdcsWPRRnAo/VgDXrNG7c8I/AAAAAAAACkE/wzme50JNHBI/s640/DH96.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Halloween haunt this year promises great things! All of the witches of the coven will make an appearance. The story is that a new witch has stepped forward to assume leadership — Vidua, the witch of suffering. Sounds like they&#39;re gearing up for something extra scary. Then apparently there is an after-haunt that pays tribute to the classic Universal monsters. I can&#39;t wait to see what these guys have waiting for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E09huy1yCZA/VgDXryaf4DI/AAAAAAAACkM/9H-gVl5veCw/s1600/DH98.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;426&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E09huy1yCZA/VgDXryaf4DI/AAAAAAAACkM/9H-gVl5veCw/s640/DH98.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zlf5S4VVJ5s/VgDXJ4IW0CI/AAAAAAAACkw/9L5qEB5HNTQ/s1600/DH101.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Zlf5S4VVJ5s/VgDXJ4IW0CI/AAAAAAAACkw/9L5qEB5HNTQ/s640/DH101.jpg&#34; width=&#34;426&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_MZX-mLqOmk/VgDXXvX39eI/AAAAAAAACfU/Ez60Um5IwXw/s1600/DH46.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;426&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_MZX-mLqOmk/VgDXXvX39eI/AAAAAAAACfU/Ez60Um5IwXw/s640/DH46.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you there, folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Straight off a Dollar Store shelf at the lovely Grapevine Mills Mall in Grapevine, Texas, and stocked just a few bins over from the storied &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2015/04/skittles-four-ways.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Orchard Skittles&lt;/a&gt;, comes Kranky Candy, the coffee dusted confection you will soon come to know and love.

You decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joining me in his first proper appearance* on Tobyblog is my good friend Brian Hammons of &lt;a href=&#34;http://reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;ReviewTheWorld.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together we sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We discover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we bring our findings to the world.

        <title>Top 10 Review the World Episodes of 2014</title>

        <description>

&lt;p&gt;One thing I love is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/27/mclaughlin_group_2014_awards_show_winners__losers_best__worst_of_the_year.html&#34;&gt;end of year retrospectives&lt;/a&gt;. And in the grand tradition I &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/top-10-review-the-world-episodes-of-2013/&#34;&gt;started last year&lt;/a&gt;, I offer to you the top ten &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;Review the World&lt;/a&gt; episodes of 2014. So clear your personal calendars, grab a bag of Rap Snacks, and settle in the for the show. These are all episodes I love, and I encourage you to watch every one in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-childhood-neighborhood-tour-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2014-12-childhood-neighborhood-tour-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/12/childhood-neighborhood-tour.html&#34;&gt;#10: Childhood Neighborhood Tour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We begin with Brian&amp;rsquo;s most recent entry, one that was intended to cap all of his furious activity for 2014, and at one point, possibly forever. Brian has been incredibly consistent at providing a new episode every week for almost two years now, a remarkable feat, and it looks like the pace may slow a bit in 2015 as he takes some time to breathe and refuel his creative juices. And what more perfect way to allude to that than by taking us back to the source primeval — where it all started — his boyhood home in Hamilton, Ohio. My only complaint is that I wish it had been a lot longer, with more backstory, maybe hitting some more significant spots. But it would ultimately be impossible to encapsulate everything that&amp;rsquo;s been catalogued over the course of 15 years on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;reviewtheworld.com&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, more than any other episode this year, with all their references to older material, this one made be want to dive in to the back catalog, which may be the point all along. At any rate, it was a great way to end the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/A-7MGlGVjos&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;9-shamrock-shake-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2014-02-shamrock-shake-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/02/shamrock-shake.html&#34;&gt;#9: Shamrock Shake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Brian&amp;rsquo;s segment for a joint review project early in the year with friend Bill Webster of &lt;a href=&#34;http://veggiemacabre.com/&#34;&gt;veggiemacabre.com&lt;/a&gt;, taking a look at McDonalds&amp;rsquo; verdant St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day offering, the Shamrock Shake. Filmed solo in the middle of a snowy Ohio February, this is a fun watch filmed with admirable gusto. Brian somehow managed to bring a little bit of spring magic into what seemed like, from Texas, a grim nightmare world of never-ending cold and snow. Maybe not quite that bad, but still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/u1ZZwgMv_r8&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; 

&lt;h3 id=&#34;8-rtw-cameo-19-crimes-wine-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2014-02-rtw-cameo-19-crimes-wine-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/02/rtw-cameo-19-crimes-wine.html&#34;&gt;#8: RtW Cameo: 19 Crimes Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a Review the World spot, or an Audio-Alpha spot? I only remember seeing it on RtW, so to Brian goes the credit. I suppose this was to be a coming out party of sorts for Brian&amp;rsquo;s friend Chris, but Audio-Alpha has had sort of a spotty internet presence since that time. Chris can still be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/AudioAlpha/videos&#34;&gt;doing his thing online&lt;/a&gt;, rapping shirtless for his many fans. Filmed in the somewhat imposing basement of Chris&amp;rsquo;s grandparents house, Brian nervously laughs his way through what turned out to be an entertaining romp of a wine review, probably filmed for the express purpose of impressing Chris&amp;rsquo;s (now) fiancée, the sultry blogesse Molly of &lt;a href=&#34;http://swaggermomtales.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;SwaggerMomTales&lt;/a&gt;. The only crime here is that we didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see acclaimed Audio-Alpha henchman and Grandma-house resident Wayman chime in with his considered opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-starring RtW stalwarts Nick and Eddie, this little vignette featuring one of RtW&amp;rsquo;s signature candy lines serves up some classic, almost textbook Review the World summer goodness. This is the Big Three at the top of their game in 2014, doing what they do best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/Jhv1__Q32Xc&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am delighted to say I had a hand in this one, as with a couple of others on this list. I bought that box of crickets for the guys back in 2013, and it quite understandably took them a while to get around to filming the review. Also shot at Chris&amp;rsquo;s grandma&amp;rsquo;s house, this time the big man himself, Wayman, joins the cast for some culinary cricket commentary. Brian stoically powers through, even though he might have been just as disgusted at regular salt &amp;amp; vinegar potato chips. Chris/Audio&amp;rsquo;s reaction is classic theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/R3Up52mJ-NE&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-rtw-cameo-beers-with-movie-sauce-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2014-07-rtw-cameo-beers-with-movie-sauce-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/07/rtw-cameo-beers-with-movie-sauce.html&#34;&gt;#5: RtW Cameo: Beers With Movie Sauce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt one of his most popular entries of the year, Brian travels to North Carolina to the home of good friend Bill Webster of &lt;a href=&#34;http://veggiemacabre.com/&#34;&gt;veggiemacabre.com&lt;/a&gt; to film an episode of Bill&amp;rsquo;s new series &amp;ldquo;Beers with Movie Sauce&amp;rdquo;. The conceipt is something like a hosted movie segment that you might have seen on a Saturday night on the USA network back in the 90&amp;rsquo;s or early 2000&amp;rsquo;s, where Bill comments on a favorite horror movie, and throws in a beer and hot sauce review as lagniappe. Bill&amp;rsquo;s vids famously have great production values, and Brian knows movies like nobody else, so the team-up was sure to be a killer. Brian&amp;rsquo;s selection, C.H.U.D. 2, made for some fun and funny discussion. Although the conversation started to drift a bit at the end, I was told this was only the first of a two-part review, the second part of which was unfortunately never forthcoming. A real bummer for us fans. Maybe one of these days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;281&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;//player.vimeo.com/video/100430338&#34; webkitallowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-zapp-s-mega-review-part-2-of-3-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2014-02-zapps-mega-review-part-2-of-3-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/02/zapps-mega-review-part-2-of-3.html&#34;&gt;#4: Zapp&amp;rsquo;s Mega Review - Part 2 of 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is near and dear to my heart. Back in 2013, Brian, Nick, and Chris teamed up to review a pack of goodies I sent their way, a box full of 10 or so varieties of Zapps potato chips. The guys went all out to film the review over three episodes, filming in some genuinely pretty and historic spots in downtown Hamilton. It looks like they had a lot of fun with it. This is my favorite of the three, but really represents the series in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/Rt1eKBC7D8o&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-dallas-roaming-lunch-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2014-05-dallas-roaming-lunch-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/05/dallas-roaming-lunch.html&#34;&gt;#3: Dallas Roaming Lunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biased, you say? Just because I made my debut appearance on RtW in this episode doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I can&amp;rsquo;t objectively critique its merit. This was a fun vid to shoot and featured some great food, to boot. If only we had got to cap it off with Taco Naan. Sigh. By the way, I can tell you that that place is still going strong and the food is better than ever! Just ate there last week. Brian, we need to do this again sometime, buddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/l1gXTs4cPZo&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, it just seems like Brian really brings it whenever he&amp;rsquo;s challenged to some joint review project. This was technically another one of those with buddy Bill, and features one of my most anticipated Cincinnati delicacies, the chili spaghetti plate, loaded with shredded cheese. The video was shot alone, indoors, in the dead of winter. Very unassuming, but full of love for this bonafide regional dish. Just a solid review with, I have to say it, some great sound. I&amp;rsquo;m no ASMR freak, but I do notice good foley work. This is like that, in a way. Just makes me hungry, is all I&amp;rsquo;m saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/8p7PWDDaFe0&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-my-zen-spot-crawford-woods-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2014-03-my-zen-spot-crawford-woods-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/03/my-zen-spot-crawford-woods.html&#34;&gt;#1: My Zen Spot: Crawford Woods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number one spot goes to another solo project, sort of a companion to the year-ending Neighborhood Tour video at number ten on my list. I might as well say that I don&amp;rsquo;t prefer Brian&amp;rsquo;s solo vids per se, just that there happened to be some really good ones this year. Also, this was Brian&amp;rsquo;s contribution to what was to be a joint video project with buddy Bill of &lt;a href=&#34;http://veggiemacabre.com/&#34;&gt;veggiemacabre.com&lt;/a&gt;, another theme that keeps popping up in this list. Crawford Woods is a spot well known to anyone familiar with Brian&amp;rsquo;s work, the site of numerous short films and reviews. Here Brian goes from using it as backdrop to making it the star of the show, attempting to explain and even capture some of that magic that keeps drawing him back to this place. Along the way we get to hear him reminisce about days gone by and get a sense of the changes that life inevitably brings to people and places. The whole thing could be described in its way as a poignant tribute, but one that ends with the acknowledgement that is as yet unfinished, which is true, because I doubt we&amp;rsquo;ve seen the last of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/I11enS0p5sQ&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year to all!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Mrgo_E1r37k/VGLpoDVtcfI/AAAAAAAABkU/2I7G8LsRERY/s1600/IMG_0676.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Mrgo_E1r37k/VGLpoDVtcfI/AAAAAAAABkU/2I7G8LsRERY/s640/IMG_0676.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you paying &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2014/02/the-beginning.html&#34;&gt;close attention&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;will remember that Tobyblog owes its existence to my good buddy Brian Hammons of the nostalgia blog&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;reviewtheworld.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. His site is a surprisingly deep personal catalog that is as much a call to action and personal philosophical movement as anything. Brian has been at this game for far longer than YouTube has been around, and has amassed an unparalleled amount of footage and articles documenting the greater part of his life, from high school hijinks to romances come and gone, to thirty-something introspections with friends. When I think about the kind of legacy he&#39;s preparing for his children, it gives me chills. They will have a chance to get to know their father in a way, perhaps, more intimate than most of us ever get to experience; a chance to get a look at the man as a man, as a friend, as a person. To know the thoughts he thought, the things that preoccupied him, the obsessions, the sillinesses, the deep things. To see him grow up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&#39;more&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IhjiboKlCpc/VGLpoOIKMAI/AAAAAAAABkQ/5xmbAs_m5VI/s1600/IMG_0669.jpg&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IhjiboKlCpc/VGLpoOIKMAI/AAAAAAAABkQ/5xmbAs_m5VI/s320/IMG_0669.jpg&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was an honor after getting to know Brian through the site and corresponding with him for a while that he chose to visit us here in Dallas. Unfortunately he was only able to stay for a couple of days, so I tried to pack in as much fun as possible during that short time. We both had the idea to film at least &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;for RtW in Dallas, so I planned the itinerary to provide us with as many opportunities for that as we cared to take advantage of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6layUbYMFRI/VGLpoYbQWaI/AAAAAAAABkY/ELH6mqBjKds/s1600/IMG_0677.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; src=&#34;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6layUbYMFRI/VGLpoYbQWaI/AAAAAAAABkY/ELH6mqBjKds/s640/IMG_0677.JPG&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian arrived on a Friday morning and after a hearty breakfast at the Old West Cafe in Grapevine, TX, I made a rather ridiculous attempt to demonstrate geocaching to him at Arbor Hills. After three successive DNFs I was beginning to think he&#39;d feel I had made the whole thing up, or at least that I wasn&#39;t very good at it. It didn&#39;t help that when I decided to show him a cache that I had already found, I couldn&#39;t locate that one either. &lt;i&gt;He&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;actually spotted it about 20 feet over from where I had last found it, someone having moved the cache slightly. Good grief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While at the park Brian spontaneously decided to film a little freestyle walking promo, dedicating it to my son Augie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/_U39R1rOZnQ?list=UUW_rtLNkTmpXQQB2VYFFoog&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;ve never seen Brian&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/search/label/freestyle%20walking&#34;&gt;Freestyle Walking series&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you&#39;re a fan of Review the World, I&#39;d encourage you to take a look. You can think of it as junior parkour, but I like to think of it as Brian and his buddies&#39; (mostly the redoubtable Nick Van Bever) noble attempt to elevate the mundane in life. With just a little effort, anything can be something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/ErlPUDz5Zgc?list=UUW_rtLNkTmpXQQB2VYFFoog&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s a little hill at the park at the top of which sits an observation tower. I took Brian up to see the view, and what should we happen upon on that Friday morning but a random bongo player practicing his craft! He was an interesting guy. We listened to him do his stuff for a while. He seemed appreciative for the audience. He had a hardcore, almost menacing look but was in fact a very affable guy. He told us he played in a metal band, but was trying to break out into jazz. Apparently the market in Dallas is pretty tough for a jazz drummer, because he was having trouble finding a gig. Who knew?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M_c6-QNq1NA/VGdrw4rzvNI/AAAAAAAABl8/1NOqOezxSlQ/s1600/IMG_0681.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M_c6-QNq1NA/VGdrw4rzvNI/AAAAAAAABl8/1NOqOezxSlQ/s1600/IMG_0681.JPG&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was getting fairly warm by the time we left, and that wasn&#39;t the end of our outdoor adventures that day. In retrospect it was a good idea that we stayed away from the house as much as possible, though it didn&#39;t spare us the inevitable. Much earlier that morning I had been awakened by my daughter. She felt sick and needed to vomit. I couldn&#39;t believe our luck. With company coming from out of state! I knew we had been hit like a meteor out of the blue with one of the dreaded super-contagious stomach bugs so common in this city. There was nothing to it but to take care of her and isolate her as much as possible. By morning she was feeling somewhat better, and we assumed it must have been an odd case of food poisoning or something. Fools!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/l1gXTs4cPZo&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Anyway, by that time we had worked up an appetite. One of the problems I ran into when planning the itinerary was that there was just too much stuff to do and eat; it was impossible to fit in everything I wanted to show this guy in just two days. So the idea I proposed was to try a &#34;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/05/dallas-roaming-lunch.html&#34;&gt;roaming lunch&lt;/a&gt;&#34;, and try to hit these three places in Irving that I was enamored with at the time, a little nosh here and little nosh there. Brian and his stomach were up for it, and this is the result. My very own debut on Review the World, and as a superfan of Brian&#39;s it was a real treat. Very proud of this one. Not only did I appear onscreen with Brian reviewing some tasty eats from my own neck of the woods, but I also got to be behind the RtW camera, which for some reason I think I enjoyed just as much.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7cwPDnyN7Lg/VGduW04f97I/AAAAAAAABmQ/M7THXBuJ8UM/s1600/IMG_0685.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7cwPDnyN7Lg/VGduW04f97I/AAAAAAAABmQ/M7THXBuJ8UM/s1600/IMG_0685.JPG&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2TlmD9n26sw/VGduWw7y_gI/AAAAAAAABmU/1YUWm2VO-18/s1600/IMG_0689.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2TlmD9n26sw/VGduWw7y_gI/AAAAAAAABmU/1YUWm2VO-18/s1600/IMG_0689.JPG&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;That night it was off to Bavarian Grill in Plano, one of our favorite places and probably the nicest restaurant that we go to regularly. It&#39;s been rated the best German restaurant in Texas many years running, and it really is a remarkable place. The live music is great and the seating is very cozy, bordering on the cramped, which I find &lt;i&gt;adds&lt;/i&gt; to the charm, perhaps a bit uncharacteristically for me. We don&#39;t normally go on Fridays, though, so we were surprised to find that Friday nights they run a beer lifting competition. Not &lt;i&gt;chugging&lt;/i&gt;, you see, but &lt;i&gt;lifting&lt;/i&gt; — which is both classier and manlier. I approved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/3BQ62Dyfeoo&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I managed to catch the very end on video, when they announced the winner. The point was to hold a large, full German-sized beer mug at the end of your outstretched arm while maintaining that arm parallel to the ground. If you started to tire and your arm dipped more than 10 degrees, you were out. It&#39;s an elimination-style competition so the last man standing was declared the winner and invited back for a tournament of champions. Great fun, and a lot of folks participated. Of course Brian and I competed and outlasted all the others, but we finally lost to the guy with the robotic arm. What are you gonna do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xYl6l-QMsxE/VGd3XRGkYdI/AAAAAAAABmo/i-fZX58tQU8/s1600/IMG_0707.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xYl6l-QMsxE/VGd3XRGkYdI/AAAAAAAABmo/i-fZX58tQU8/s1600/IMG_0707.JPG&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The next morning after an outstanding South American breakfast at Cafe de Brazil we brunched at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/07/avocado-california-roll-sushi-garland-tx.html&#34;&gt;Avocado Sushi&lt;/a&gt;, &#39;cause, frankly folks, Brian just freaking demanded it. Brian is a sushi hound, and can pack away vast, vast quantities of rice and fish. I had been talking up Avocado for a while in our IMs, and he just couldn&#39;t leave Dallas without trying it, even if that meant we had to pull off another, far more loaded wandering lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/6kO8mV62Yzs&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what can I say? That place delivers. The sushi menu is huge, and a lot of it obviously caters to more American tastes. It&#39;s a great spot to bring someone if you want to introduce them to sushi, because there&#39;s more than a little for everyone, including those who are squeamish about raw fish. Their presentation is also top notch — the dishes were just beautiful; no buffet bar rolls there. We were in the moment and the place wasn&#39;t too crowded that morning, so we decided to do a full review at table, which is kind of rare thing among RtW restaurant reviews. It was also my son Augie&#39;s first recorded appearance on RtW, and I don&#39;t mind saying he did me proud, as he always does. Both he and my daughter are also longtime fans of Brian&#39;s, though I don&#39;t show them absolutely &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; on Review the World. It&#39;s a PG-13 site, after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;separator&#34; style=&#34;clear: both; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9lHTMQjOBQU/VGd-poVnD4I/AAAAAAAABm4/_3v5aRitW58/s1600/IMG_0698.JPG&#34; imageanchor=&#34;1&#34; style=&#34;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&#34;&gt;&lt;img border=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9lHTMQjOBQU/VGd-poVnD4I/AAAAAAAABm4/_3v5aRitW58/s1600/IMG_0698.JPG&#34; height=&#34;240&#34; width=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to Avocado I took Brian and Augie out to World Market to scout for some potential review material. I had something specific in mind, but while we were there we decided to pick up some additional items, because we were really feeling it that morning. I don&#39;t know how we decided on the theme; I guess it just kind of evolved — &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/09/3-green-sodas.html&#34;&gt;three green drinks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/A5gvaCeGLlQ&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;These were some pretty exotic colors and flavors, and I think they made for a great little review vid, and maybe Augie&#39;s best. It felt like we were in Emerald City in that pretty little courtyard, sipping our green sodas. Shortly after that I decided to commemorate Brian&#39;s visit with a series of geocaches in honor of Review the World, and I placed the first one right near where we shot this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/e4XYkECyFfg&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Beautiful Breckinridge park. I love that place. Anybody who doubts its grandeur has never seen it in mid-April, with the firewheels in full bloom. Or maybe in early June, when their time is close to spent, their colors no longer vivid, but still very striking with burnt oranges and auburns replacing the intense golds and reds. We caught &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/06/swamp-pop.html#comment-form&#34;&gt;some of that here&lt;/a&gt;, which I&#39;m glad of, but still not nearly enough to get a real sense of the place. &lt;a href=&#34;http://drinkswamppop.com/&#34;&gt;Swamp Pop&lt;/a&gt; sodas are a sort of hometown novelty, being brewed and bottled in Lafayette, Louisiana where I went to college. What really caught my eye is that they use unique fruits native to South Louisiana to put a spin on traditional soda pop flavors — fig sugar cane cola, satsuma orange pop, etc. I only regret that we weren&#39;t able to get a bottle of the ginger ale, as I would have liked in particular to try that. It was a really fun vid to shoot. Brian had some creative ideas for the camera work, and it came out really well, I thought. The only sad thing is that my final review under the bridge is almost completely obscured by wind, marring what would have been my favorite of the Dallas reviews.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/_SEkyoAPd8U&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I even made a cameo in Brian&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/08/four-small-candies.html&#34;&gt;Four Small Candies review&lt;/a&gt;, where I tried Chick-o-sticks for the first time. Brian attempted to choke a goose with a small chunk of candy, but they were too smart for his ruse. We filmed that segment right after the Swamp Pop review in the same park, with the last bit of juice left in Brian&#39;s camera battery. I think by that point we all felt like we had given him a lot of material to take back to Ohio, much more than we had initially planned. And I know at least I was happy with how it all turned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#39;s basically how I would like to remember the trip, because it was in the hours after that that things started to take a decided turn for the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We headed to Dallas proper to hit the flagship Lakewood location of Dallas&#39; own Liberty Burger franchise, a joint that I had been pushing to Brian for months. Gourmet burgers, crazy awesome LTO specials, local beers, Liberty Burger had it all. Unfortunately, in the weeks prior to his visit I had cooled on the place, what with quality slipping at the original location and an outrageous incident involving extremely rude behavior by the wait staff at the Addison branch. I figured we&#39;d give the new flagship a shot, especially since I&#39;d heard they&#39;d put so much work into making the place acceptable to the Lakewood property snobs. When we arrived I was unimpressed. I hate to say it, but I think aggressive expansion has cost Liberty Burger its soul. It&#39;s just not the place it once was. The LTOs have lost their old originality and seasonal flavor, and the quality is inconsistent at best these days. The Lakewood venue, contrary to my expectations, was not on the floor that much different from the other locations. I&#39;m not sure what the fuss was all about. The food was good, I suppose. At least that&#39;s what I remember Brian and Augie saying. I&#39;m not sure I ate all that much, or at all. Because, truth be told, I already sensed at that point what was coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From there we visited White Rock Lake where my plan was to film an epic co-review of two entries in &lt;a href=&#34;http://lakewoodbrewing.com/legendary/&#34;&gt;Lakewood Brewery&#39;s Legendary beer series&lt;/a&gt;, the ones&amp;nbsp;dedicated to a couple of Dallas urban legends centering around the lake, the infamous White Lady and the temperamental Goat Man.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/bBI4itQAFMQ&#34; width=&#34;560&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;The review was rushed, and fell somewhat short of &#34;epic&#34;. We filmed it on my iPhone with Augie doing the camera work. I could tell Brian was somewhat nervous about being busted for having an open container of alcohol on park grounds, probably justifiably. At any rate, I didn&#39;t want to get him in too much trouble down in the Southland, so we ended up doing the review part as quickly and surreptitiously as possible, particularly because we were attracting glances and patrol vehicles were in the area. Also, I had neglected to study up beforehand on the legends in question. And also I was starting to get sick.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;And there was a lot of wind in that one, too.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Still, though, it was fun and I look back on that silly vid as my sentimental favorite from the trip. I think it would be voted the &#34;People&#39;s Choice&#34; if I were to nominate it to myself up against the other five. What do you say?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Epilogue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Brian&#39;s visit was intended to end with a grand spectacle — dinner and a tournament at Medieval Times. Instead it ended with the grand spectacle of my son puking his guts out in the back seat of my car immediately behind me as we were pulling up to the house. There was a dinner and there was a tournament, but sadly I did not participate. I made it as far as the gates of the castle, but once inside I played the part of the medieval plague victim. I spent roughly two hours splayed out on a bench in the main lobby, without shame, while anxious employees peppered me with questions about the horses. Apparently they have a lot of people faint when the horses come out. No, I was fine with the horses. Was I sure? Yes. Was I really sure, because a lot of people think they can handle being in the presence of a horse, but they really can&#39;t. No, I assured them, it was just a stomach bug.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Just.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I eventually had to move closer to the bathrooms. Mercifully an opportunity arose where no one was in sight, and I forced myself to shuffle over to the toilet where I spasmodically vomited up all of the excesses of the last two days, in some sort of surreal karmic purge. I felt like I hovered over that toilet for half an hour at least. When it was all over I cleaned up as best I could and drug myself out to the bench again, telling myself that I felt somewhat better now and could probably even make it home. That lasted for about 10 minutes, then I was down again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;I gave Brian the keys, because I wan&#39;t driving anywhere. By the time we made it home Augie was down. My wife informed me that while we were out the baby had started vomiting, and within an hour of hour of our arrival she had started as well. With my last gasp of strength I told Brian just to seal himself in the room and not to open the door for anyone, and not to come out till morning, no matter what he heard happening on the other side of the door. You guys should have seen the look on his face. Priceless. I wish I could have taken a selfie with him right at that moment, with me giving a thumbs up and him doing that face. Exactly the way you want to leave an esteemed and honored guest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;The passing of that night was something awful, something that will be remembered in the annals of our family for many years to come. And as I recall lying there on the couch with the dog pestering me for attention, or a walk, or just out of sheer sadistic pleasure, I think I can say that I hit rock bottom in my relationship with that dog on that particular night. It&#39;ll only be less frustrating from here on out, and I suppose I can be thankful for that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Somehow I was given the grace to be able to drive Brian out to the airport the next morning, a drive that was admittedly and quite understandably awkward. What a note to have to leave on! I didn&#39;t know how he&#39;d feel about the trip or if he&#39;d ever want to come back, especially if he came down with the bug on the plane or on the drive home, or brought some exotic disease home to his family. As fate and good fortune would have it, he never got sick. It took us probably five days to fully recover. Even now I&#39;m still wary of sushi and haven&#39;t tried Swamp Pop since because of the illogical, but very real and completely physical, associations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;Brian and I remained in touch and I&#39;m happy to say that my presence continued to be felt in other videos on Review the World and Cheap Thrills, the successor to the old Brian and Tim YouTube series. I even got a name drop once during one of Brian&#39;s appearances on &lt;a href=&#34;http://veggiemacabre.com/&#34;&gt;veggiemacabre.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Hopefully on the balance I&#39;ve added, and not subtracted, from the RtW vibe. Decide for yourself. Brian — thanks, buddy, and you&#39;re always welcome back!&lt;/div&gt;

        <guid>http://tobyblog.com/posts/top-10-review-the-world-episodes-of-2013/</guid>
        <description>

&lt;p&gt;Since Brian and Review the World were my main inspirations in starting my own blog, I figured it would be fitting to begin by introducing some of my favorite episodes from the past year. According to Brian, 2013 was one of the busiest years he&amp;rsquo;s ever had on the site, and it shows. He had a ton of great content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-the-brian-and-tim-show-episode-25-halloween-extra-ufo-and-ghost-discussion-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2013-10-b-show-25-ufo-ghost-discussion-html-m-0&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2013/10/b-show-25-ufo-ghost-discussion.html?m=0&#34;&gt;#10: The Brian and Tim Show Episode #25: Halloween Extra - UFO and Ghost Discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sort of an extended special segment of the 2013 Halloween episode, Brian and Tim decide to talk about their own experiences with the paranormal. Basically this was how my cousins and I spent many a late night when I was younger, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure by the end of this you&amp;rsquo;ll be talking to your screen wanting to add your two cents. Who knows? Maybe some of mine will get featured on this blog one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3nAdksT_dCw&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;9-rtw-killer-buzz-energy-drinks-review-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2013-10-killer-buzz-energy-drinks-html-m-0&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2013/10/killer-buzz-energy-drinks.html?m=0&#34;&gt;#9: RtW: Killer Buzz Energy Drinks Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An energy drink company wanting to generate some viral &amp;ldquo;buzz&amp;rdquo; sent Brian a case of their product to review. He and the gang thoroughly dissect the various offerings, and by the end I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll be asking &amp;ldquo;What was &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; that stuff?&amp;rdquo; Great fun, but I doubt you&amp;rsquo;ll be seeing clips from this one featured in the Killer Buzz Super Bowl ad. Their mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tS_YrzOKWwI&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;8-drinking-an-unopened-can-of-pepsi-summer-mix-from-2007-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2013-07-drinking-can-of-pepsi-summer-mix-from-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2013/07/drinking-can-of-pepsi-summer-mix-from.html&#34;&gt;#8: Drinking An Unopened Can of Pepsi Summer Mix from 2007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seemed like a fun time hanging out with the Michaels boys. Sweet summer vibe permeates this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Zrz27EVrd0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-the-brian-and-tim-show-episode-19-brand-name-vs-generics-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2013-08-b-show-19-brand-name-vs-generics-sprite-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2013/08/b-show-19-brand-name-vs-generics-sprite.html&#34;&gt;#7: The Brian and Tim Show Episode #19: Brand Name vs. Generics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim&amp;rsquo;s methodical and scientific approach provides an almost comedic structure to this massive take down of the universe of lemon-lime soda offerings. Only one problem: sorry, guys – &lt;em&gt;7-Up is clearly the superior beverage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/owDamdNm0gw&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-rtw-munchies-doritos-supreme-pizza-sandwich-crackers-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2013-10-munchies-doritos-supreme-pizza-sandwich-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2013/10/munchies-doritos-supreme-pizza-sandwich.html&#34;&gt;#6: RtW: Munchies Doritos Supreme Pizza Sandwich Crackers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful Hamilton architecture, sublime lighting, funny segues, and a stylistic flair showcase Review the World in its maturity and splendor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/majlMHrA4C4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-rtw-giants-roasted-corn-snacks-review-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2013-09-giants-roasted-corn-snacks-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2013/09/giants-roasted-corn-snacks.html&#34;&gt;#5: RtW: Giants Roasted Corn Snacks Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pretty standard snack review unexpectedly turns into a found footage urban expo thriller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/23hPUMGRJRw&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-rtw-exploring-dabbelt-s-market-hamilton-oh-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2013-12-exploring-dabbelts-market-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2013/12/exploring-dabbelts-market.html&#34;&gt;#4: RtW: Exploring Dabbelt&amp;rsquo;s Market - Hamilton, OH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some hidden camera work lends a voyeuristic appeal to this expose of a rundown convenience store. Anything to get a Slush Puppie, also a fond memory from my own childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MgGWbR_P7rg&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-get-in-the-trunk-3-all-trunks-go-to-heaven-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2013-09-get-in-trunk-3-trunk-strikes-back-29-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2013/09/get-in-trunk-3-trunk-strikes-back_29.html&#34;&gt;#3: Get In the Trunk 3: All Trunks Go to Heaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To those unfamiliar with Brian&amp;rsquo;s short films, I would encourage them to &lt;a href=&#34;http://reviewtheworldblog.blogspot.com/search/label/movie&#34;&gt;explore them here&lt;/a&gt;. Already a fun series, All Trunks reaches new heights in this one. The story is tighter and the action much more intense. Also, I get a mention in this one, sort of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cevuIHyc3DI&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-five-for-5-dollar-store-challenge-feat-rtw-dino-drac-vm-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2013-05-five-for-5-dollar-store-challenge-feat-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2013/05/five-for-5-dollar-store-challenge-feat.html&#34;&gt;#2: Five for $5 Dollar Store Challenge feat. RtW, Dino Drac, &amp;amp; VM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My introduction to Review the World, as it was for many people, I&amp;rsquo;m sure. Both Brian and I are big fans of X-Entertainment, the sort of previous incarnation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://dinosaurdracula.com/&#34;&gt;Dinosaur Dracula&lt;/a&gt;. Brian is on top of his game in this one and provides, in my opinion, the most entertaining entry of this cross-blog challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TXaOuh38-qo&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-go-road-trip-5-http-www-reviewtheworld-com-2013-03-go-road-trip-5-html&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2013/03/go-road-trip-5.html&#34;&gt;#1: Go! Road Trip #5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only my favorite of 2013, but also my favorite RtW video of all time. The Go! Road Trip series is among Brian&amp;rsquo;s absolute best work, and perfectly embodies the spirit of the blog, and I think the spirit of the man as well. The ending soliloquy is nothing short of moving. As a bonus, the video closes with a track from Ultima Exodus, my favorite NES game. Well done.&lt;/p&gt;
