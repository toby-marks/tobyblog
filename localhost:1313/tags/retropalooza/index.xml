      <description>Yesterday I took the kids to the amazing Retropalooza convention in Arlington, Texas, and boy did we have a blast!

Take a look at some of the fun things we discovered.
The owner of Tendril here was willing to let him go for a meagre forty dollars, making it the best deal I found.</description>
