      <description>#pic { display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; }   2015 was the year I discovered Dark Hour Haunted House, and you probably realize by now what a fan I am. We are very fortunate to live in an area with access to a year round haunt. To be able to be successful at that requires a level of quality and showmanship, frankly, above your average haunt. Not to detract from anyone else in the business (no one can do it all!</description>

      <description>I discovered The Dark Hour in March, at St. Patrick&#39;s Day of all times, and I fell in love. I don&#39;t have the skills to work there, but I think if I could just secretly sneak in and live there, I would. I&#39;d be like that weird guy from the movies who lives between the walls somehow, and you hear him rummaging around in the fridge at night. Just hope I don&#39;t get caught!</description>

      <description>This year I attended Texas Frightmare Weekend for the first time. By now it seems like forever ago. But lucky you â€” I saved all the pictures! So here they are without much verbal adornment, or it&amp;rsquo;d probably take me another month and a half to get this up.

I suggest you take your time with this post. It&amp;rsquo;s a big one. Really savor the photographs. Left-click to enlarge them.</description>
