      <description>One thing I love is end of year retrospectives. And in the grand tradition I started last year, I offer to you the top ten Review the World episodes of 2014. So clear your personal calendars, grab a bag of Rap Snacks, and settle in the for the show. These are all episodes I love, and I encourage you to watch every one in its entirety.
#10: Childhood Neighborhood Tour We begin with Brian&amp;rsquo;s most recent entry, one that was intended to cap all of his furious activity for 2014, and at one point, possibly forever.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since Brian and Review the World were my main inspirations in starting my own blog, I figured it would be fitting to begin by introducing some of my favorite episodes from the past year. According to Brian, 2013 was one of the busiest years he&amp;rsquo;s ever had on the site, and it shows. He had a ton of great content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-the-brian-and-tim-show-episode-25-halloween-extra---ufo-and-ghost-discussionhttpwwwreviewtheworldcom201310b-show-25-ufo-ghost-discussionhtmlm0&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2013/10/b-show-25-ufo-ghost-discussion.html?m=0&#34;&gt;#10: The Brian and Tim Show Episode #25: Halloween Extra - UFO and Ghost Discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sort of an extended special segment of the 2013 Halloween episode, Brian and Tim decide to talk about their own experiences with the paranormal. Basically this was how my cousins and I spent many a late night when I was younger, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure by the end of this you&amp;rsquo;ll be talking to your screen wanting to add your two cents. Who knows? Maybe some of mine will get featured on this blog one day.&lt;/p&gt;
