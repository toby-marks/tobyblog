	  <p>One thing I love is <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/27/mclaughlin_group_2014_awards_show_winners__losers_best__worst_of_the_year.html">end of year retrospectives</a>. And in the grand tradition I <a href="https://tobyblog.com/posts/20140202-top10-reviewtheworld-episodes-of-2013/">started last year</a>, I offer to you the top ten <a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/">Review the World</a> episodes of 2014. So clear your personal calendars, grab a bag of Rap Snacks, and settle in the for the show. These are all episodes I love, and I encourage you to watch every one in its entirety.</p>
<h3 id="10-childhood-neighborhood-tourhttpwwwreviewtheworldcom201412childhood-neighborhood-tourhtml"><a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2014/12/childhood-neighborhood-tour.html">#10: Childhood Neighborhood Tour</a></h3>
<p>We begin with Brian&rsquo;s most recent entry, one that was intended to cap all of his furious activity for 2014, and at one point, possibly forever. Brian has been incredibly consistent at providing a new episode every week for almost two years now, a remarkable feat, and it looks like the pace may slow a bit in 2015 as he takes some time to breathe and refuel his creative juices. And what more perfect way to allude to that than by taking us back to the source primeval ‚Äî where it all started ‚Äî his boyhood home in Hamilton, Ohio. My only complaint is that I wish it had been a lot longer, with more backstory, maybe hitting some more significant spots. But it would ultimately be impossible to encapsulate everything that&rsquo;s been catalogued over the course of 15 years on <a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/">reviewtheworld.com</a>. In fact, more than any other episode this year, with all their references to older material, this one made be want to dive in to the back catalog, which may be the point all along. At any rate, it was a great way to end the year.</p>

	  <p>Since Brian and Review the World were my main inspirations in starting my own blog, I figured it would be fitting to begin by introducing some of my favorite episodes from the past year. According to Brian, 2013 was one of the busiest years he&rsquo;s ever had on the site, and it shows. He had a ton of great content.</p>
<h3 id="10-the-brian-and-tim-show-episode-25-halloween-extra---ufo-and-ghost-discussionhttpwwwreviewtheworldcom201310b-show-25-ufo-ghost-discussionhtmlm0"><a href="http://www.reviewtheworld.com/2013/10/b-show-25-ufo-ghost-discussion.html?m=0">#10: The Brian and Tim Show Episode #25: Halloween Extra - UFO and Ghost Discussion</a></h3>
<p>Sort of an extended special segment of the 2013 Halloween episode, Brian and Tim decide to talk about their own experiences with the paranormal. Basically this was how my cousins and I spent many a late night when I was younger, and I&rsquo;m sure by the end of this you&rsquo;ll be talking to your screen wanting to add your two cents. Who knows? Maybe some of mine will get featured on this blog one day.</p>
