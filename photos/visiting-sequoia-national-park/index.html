<p>Our week in Pasadena was a working vacation, which meant Kassi was essentially just tagging along with me on my monthly visit to the client. But as we did in Hawaii, we tacked on a couple of free days to the front of the trip for some fun time in California. We had a lot of options for how to spend our time. We considered Joshua Tree National Park which was a strong favorite of mine, as well as a simple drive up the coast north of Santa Monica. I even bought a magazine on California road trips at the grocery store. There really is so much beauty in that state. I wouldn&rsquo;t think any other state compares, no slight to Texas. But Sequoia was firmly number one on my list of things within reasonable driving distance of Pasadena, and nothing I heard or read about topped the appeal of seeing those massive trees, the largest in the world. I don&rsquo;t really have a &ldquo;bucket list&rdquo; as such, but if I did this trip would be one I&rsquo;d be checking off. But that makes it seem like we&rsquo;re done with it. I consider this more of a recon trip for a future visit with the whole family, where we&rsquo;re hopefully able to take in more of the sites. As it was we only had a short time there, and a few of the more spectacular photo attractions were inaccessible due to the planned burns that just happened to be still underway in the park.</p>

          and this is <span style="font-style:italic;">Tobyblog</span> — the personal blog and home page of one of the web's many Tobys. What distinguishes me is that I own the domain. To you I say <span style="font-weight:bold; font-variant:small-caps;">welcome</span> in the grand old tradition of proto-websites of the nineties. This is the place where I deposit the overflow of my time, energy, and labors. Tobyblog is my refuge from the coming social media apocalypse.
