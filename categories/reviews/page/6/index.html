<p>Here in North Texas the sun is shining. The weather is warming up. The world outside is getting brighter. The Texas wildflowers are already in bloom, thanks to a mild and soggy winter. In the woods, things are moving. The itchy season is upon us, and the window of opportunity for a lot of local geocaches is closing, as the casual players tend to steer clear of anything that might put them in the way of tall grass, poison ivy, or the dreaded tick.</p>

<p>Do you remember <a href="https://tobyblog.com/posts/20150410-a-visit-to-collectors-crypt/">Collector&rsquo;s Crypt?</a> I wrote about that place around this time last year. It&rsquo;s closed now. I had a dream about it the other night, or rather its next incarnation, which was as a hybrid Christmas/Halloween store. I know the owners have an interest in Christmas things, so that detail is not too surprising. But in my dream, there was also a functional toilet over by the register. I&rsquo;m not sure what that was supposed to mean.</p>

<p>2015 was the year I discovered <a href="https://tobyblog.com/posts/20150921-the-dark-hour-best-haunt-ever/">Dark Hour Haunted House</a>, and you probably realize by now what a fan I am. We are very fortunate to live in an area with access to a year round haunt. To be able to be successful at that requires a level of quality and showmanship, frankly, above your average haunt. Not to detract from anyone else in the business (no one can do it all!), but I think it does hold true. In getting to know these guys and the haunt itself a little better over these past few months, it is becoming clear how much of an inspiration they are to other folks in the industry. And I&rsquo;ve still not yet discovered all they have to offer!</p>

<p>I discovered The Dark Hour in March, at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day of all times, and I fell in love. I don&rsquo;t have the skills to work there, but I think if I could just secretly sneak in and live there, I would. I&rsquo;d be like that weird guy from the movies who lives between the walls somehow, and you hear him rummaging around in the fridge at night. Just hope I don&rsquo;t get caught! Cause you know, awkward.</p>
