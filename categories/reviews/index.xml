      <description>Looks to me like South Louisiana microbrews are coming of age. I think the time has come to get my hand on a few of these.</description>

      <title>Got the Munchies? Try Hypnotic Donuts.</title>

&lt;p&gt;It was a rainy, Seattle-y Saturday morning in Dallas when I decided to take the kids out for a Daddy-Daughter-Baby Day run to Hypnotic Donuts, one of those fancy donut places that seem to be popping up around town these days like vape shops were five about years ago. They&amp;rsquo;d been asking me to take them on a Pokémon hunt, and I decided I&amp;rsquo;d treat them to breakfast as a bonus and incentive for getting up extra early.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This video is something of a personal achievement, having been now just under two years in the making, and passing, as it does, yet another milestone in the revitalization of this little blog. Yeah, I know, that&amp;rsquo;s sort of a grandiose way to introduce a video where I discuss the merits of quail eggs and potato chips with friends and family, but there we are. It means something to me — hard to quantify — to be active on the site again.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The weather was warmer today. I could feel spring in my bones. I get that way around this time of year. Maybe I was feeling a little homesick. Whatever the case, I&amp;rsquo;ve been craving Mexican food. I noticed this little while walking around during my lunch break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was standing outside the door reading the posted menuboard, an older lady passing by said to me &amp;ldquo;Go in. You&amp;rsquo;ll like it. It&amp;rsquo;s really good.&amp;rdquo; I took that as a sign.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Good Times at the El Portal</title>

&lt;p&gt;I took a detour that night after my trip to the antique store. I passed along back streets, out of the way plazas, anywhere that looked like it might afford me new scenery. I stumbled across El Portal behind the headquarters of the Planetary Society, its aromas drawing my attention before I&amp;rsquo;d even rounded the corner to lay site on the place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;



This year while out shopping for turkey and wine, I discovered a couple of very fallish, and very Thanksgiving-appropriate beverages I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share with you all. One is a new seasonal coffee brew from my favorite DFW brewery &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinhousebrewing.com/&#34;&gt;Martin House&lt;/a&gt;, and the other is a special cider I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in three years — &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/ace-pineapple-cider-shannon-irish-red/&#34;&gt;Ace&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; own extraordinary Pumpkin Cider.

      <description>Joined once again by nostalgia blogger and good friend Brian Hammons of reviewtheworld.com, Augie and I team up to complete our trilogy of Skittles reviews, this time looking at the legendary and rarely sighted Cauldron Skittles variety, now in its second year on store shelves. Does the candy itself live up to the promise of its bright orange bag? We find out, and the answer may just shock you. (It probably won&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Join me, Augie, and superpal Brian of Review the World for installment number two in this soon to be classic trilogy of Skittles candy reviews. This time we look at Brightside Skittles, the very flipside of the Darkside reviewed a couple of years back with Brian on his last visit to Dallas. A great theme for summer and sunny days, will Brightside warm your tummy as we slip into fall and all things pumpkin spice?</description>

      <description>Hello again, folks.
It has been a while now since I&amp;rsquo;ve been active on this site, but life has not held still for me and the family. Since the last time I posted anything of significance, quite a great deal has happened, actually, much of which was originally destined for publication here. Well, as it does, life got in the way, priorities shifted, my free time diminished, etc. etc. — and the gist of it all is that you folks were left unattended for many months.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year again folks, that magical time between Christmas and New Year where thoughtful commentators like myself come out with their end of year retrospectives; and continuing a tradition I established a couple of years back on this site, I intend to give you my take on the best of my buddy Brian Hammons&amp;rsquo; output over on the internet&amp;rsquo;s most beloved nostalgia blog, ReviewTheWorld.com.

      <description>After a long hiatus, my front seat food review series is back! This time I feature some of the Waco area&amp;rsquo;s finest gas station Czech cuisine. If you&amp;rsquo;re ever in the area you should absolutely stop at one or both of these fine establishments. Such a treat.

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2015 was the year I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tobyblog.com/2015/09/the-dark-hour-best-haunt-ever.html&#34;&gt;Dark Hour Haunted House&lt;/a&gt;, and you probably realize by now what a fan I am. We are very fortunate to live in an area with access to a year round haunt. To be able to be successful at that requires a level of quality and showmanship, frankly, above your average haunt. Not to detract from anyone else in the business (no one can do it all!), but I think it does hold true. In getting to know these guys and the haunt itself a little better over these past few months, it is becoming clear how much of an inspiration they are to other folks in the industry. And I&amp;rsquo;ve still not yet discovered all they have to offer!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Katie and the gang over at Cheap Thrills invited me and the kids to do a co-review highlighting some of our favorite summer treats. You can check out their submission, Culver&amp;rsquo;s Frozen Custard, below.
  Naturally, I jumped at the chance to introduce you guys to one of the hidden treasures of our little neighborhood — Bahama Bucks!
Bucks is sort of like Jimmy Buffett&amp;rsquo;s own sno-cone stand. It serves sno-cones and tropical smoothies, some coffee drinks, and you can even get mixed fruit cups there if you&amp;rsquo;d like.</description>

      <description>Straight off a Dollar Store shelf at the lovely Grapevine Mills Mall in Grapevine, Texas, and stocked just a few bins over from the storied Orchard Skittles, comes Kranky Candy, the coffee dusted confection you will soon come to know and love. Is it an afternoon snack? A breakfast substitute? Repurposed industrial by-product? You decide.
Joining me in his first proper appearance* on Tobyblog is my good friend Brian Hammons of ReviewTheWorld.</description>

      <description>My buddy Brian Hammons over at Review the World requested another video food review, so I though I&amp;rsquo;d introduce him to a down-home treat from my childhood. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re happy with the results. I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna lie, this one is a bit of a deep dive; a little something for my hardcore devotees. That is, people that like watching me eat stuff in my car. And yes, I manage to add yet another stain to my car seat.</description>

Enjoy.

      <description>(Works best if you read this in an Andy Rooney-esque whine.)
This keeps happening to me over and over and over again lately. I have to make use of the public facilities (seldom a delightful experience anyway), I go to the sink, wash my hands, look up, and see this mess —
Now what is wrong with this picture? Take a look at how this works.
You&amp;rsquo;re supposed to pull the sheets from the bottom, and the angular momentum of your pull dispenses the next sheet.</description>

      <description>This is an older review from TheVCubeSolver and I very much inspired by the hijinks of Brian Hammons and the gang over at Review the World. In it we take a look at a couple of different varieties of Taki&amp;rsquo;s chips and some cane sugar soda pops we picked up at the local coffee shop.
Oh, and you&amp;rsquo;ll notice I&amp;rsquo;m calling myself &amp;ldquo;Meeks, the Pedestrian&amp;rdquo;. Cause we were trying to have code names or something.</description>

      <description>Back in the summer of 2013 TheVCubeSolver and I dropped by the local candy shop to review Blue Bunny&amp;rsquo;s Jolly Rancher Cool Tubes, a push-pop like product in three weird flavors. It turned out to be a complete and total sensory experience.
