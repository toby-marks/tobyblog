      <description>Forever remind yourself.&#xA;The comments section on this video describes it as 70&amp;rsquo;s Italian cocaine lounge music. Psychedelia. Dunno, but I like it. I suppose this goes out to all you folks tripping today in Oregon.</description>

      <description>This is the guy that taught me and Kass to appreciate jazz, literally. He was our old jazz and music appreciation professor in college. On a couple of occasions we went to see him and his band play around town. Neat guy, and some people said we kind of resembled each other.&#xA;I always found this sound makes for good study music. This is his third album, I believe, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty strong.</description>

      <description>Currently enjoying this sweet cover of one of my favorite Blossom Dearie tracks. That&amp;rsquo;s not the only Blossom Dearie song they cover, too. Apparently somebody over there is a fan.&#xA;If there were more covers of her music I&amp;rsquo;d love to do another cover battle, but alas. Blossom is too much underappreciated.</description>

      <description>My working playlist for today. Makes me think about remoting from the old Collin Creek mall. I miss that place.</description>

      <description>Some of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to over the past week. This is a recording of the church choir taken after Palm Sunday liturgy. I believe it&amp;rsquo;s meant to be instructional for the other cantors who will be assisting during Holy Week services.</description>

      <description>I found out Bill Withers died today. Not a huge fan, but I am rather fond of this one of his.&#xA;I used that song in the intro to one of my old videos, one I did with Augie back in my personal golden age of geocaching.&#xA;I miss those days.</description>

      <description>While I&amp;rsquo;m at it I might as well post this, too, since Josh got such a kick out of it. I sent this to him a week or so ago, then days later he&amp;rsquo;s in the hospital. Great timing on my part. Maybe he didn&amp;rsquo;t follow soon enough the sober and thoughtful advice given in this video.&#xA;Get well, my brother.</description>
