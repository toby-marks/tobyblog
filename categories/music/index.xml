      <description>Forever remind yourself.
  The comments section on this video describes it as 70&amp;rsquo;s Italian cocaine lounge music. Psychedelia. Dunno, but I like it. I suppose this goes out to all you folks tripping today in Oregon.</description>

      <description>This is the guy that taught me and Kass to appreciate jazz, literally. He was our old jazz and music appreciation professor in college. On a couple of occasions we went to see him and his band play around town. Neat guy, and some people said we kind of resembled each other.
I always found this sound makes for good study music. This is his third album, I believe, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty strong.</description>

      <description>Currently enjoying this sweet cover of one of my favorite Blossom Dearie tracks. That&amp;rsquo;s not the only Blossom Dearie song they cover, too. Apparently somebody over there is a fan.
If there were more covers of her music I&amp;rsquo;d love to do another cover battle, but alas. Blossom is too much underappreciated.

&lt;p&gt;Recent events got me resurrecting an old feature of the site that I&amp;rsquo;ve neglected far too long.

      <description>Some of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to over the past week. This is a recording of the church choir taken after Palm Sunday liturgy. I believe it&amp;rsquo;s meant to be instructional for the other cantors who will be assisting during Holy Week services.</description>

      <description>I found out Bill Withers died today. Not a huge fan, but I am rather fond of this one of his.
  I used that song in the intro to one of my old videos, one I did with Augie back in my personal golden age of geocaching.
I miss those days.</description>

      <description>While I&amp;rsquo;m at it I might as well post this, too, since Josh got such a kick out of it. I sent this to him a week or so ago, then days later he&amp;rsquo;s in the hospital. Great timing on my part. Maybe he didn&amp;rsquo;t follow soon enough the sober and thoughtful advice given in this video.
Get well, my brother.

      <description>Is this the most chill song in the world?
 In fact, listening to that one song ‚Äî ‚ÄúWeightless‚Äù ‚Äî resulted in a striking 65 percent reduction in participants‚Äô overall anxiety, and a 35 percent reduction in their usual physiological resting rates.
 I have a lot of tracks I listen to alter or set my mood, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen the phenomenon quantified so neatly. I&amp;rsquo;d like to see the measurable improvements in focus, attention, or creativity that music is capable of producing.</description>

      <description>For all you folks out there enjoying the savings and discounts, and perhaps needing a little mood music to go along with.
  You might recognize that one. It&amp;rsquo;s sort of famous. Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the entire playlist, which I don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be able to embed on my page. Maybe that doesn&amp;rsquo;t even make sense. The 1950s gave birth to shopping music, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure its bright and chipper tone has ever been topped.</description>

      <description>One of my earliest memories is asking my mom to borrow an old Hallmark music box that played this song. It was important to me, though I couldn&amp;rsquo;t explain why. I&amp;rsquo;d listen to it over and over again, long past the point of annoyance to everyone. Sometimes at night, when I was scared, I&amp;rsquo;d listen to it to help me sleep. It has a sad, but sweet melody. At about 2:00 it has the proper timing, then very quickly starts to unwind.</description>

      <description>Well, well. And I thought they&amp;rsquo;d retired. I suppose there are still a few living acts I&amp;rsquo;d pay to see after all. üê¶üêù No idea whether we&amp;rsquo;ll make it out to this one, but might bee nice.
Read all about my love for their Hall and Oates cover album. And give those songs a deep listen.

      <title>Brown Noise Tracks for Intense Focus</title>
      <link>http://tobyblog.com/posts/2019-03-08-brown-noise/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2019 12:31:10 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://tobyblog.com/posts/2019-03-08-brown-noise/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve had the need to maintain a greater focus in my work and study. I find brown noise to be good way of filtering out distractions, to allow the mind to concentrate on a task. Brown noise tends to sit at a lower frequency than white noise, so the sound is deeper and more meditative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tracks that I like. Use headphones to get the most out of these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHM-ympOZo0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very low, like a muffled waterfall from a distance. Very good track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I discovered the The Bird and Bee this past December when I heard their rendition of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/2018-12-21-my-favorite-christmas-songs/&#34;&gt;The Twelve Days of Christmas&lt;/a&gt; at a bar in Honolulu. That led me to this album, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been burning it up lately on drives and at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/V7rExwCkRYI&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      <description>A pop take on jazz noir from his best album. Many years ago Kass and I listened to this cassette so much we broke the tape.
I hope you all are having a mellow moment, whenever it is for you. I know I am.
I find jazz noir goes best with whiskey.

      <title>A Few of My Favorite Christmas Songs</title>
      <link>http://tobyblog.com/posts/2018-12-21-my-favorite-christmas-songs/</link>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hands down my favorite Christmas song of 2018. I passed up this album in favor of Jackie Gleason&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Tis The Season&lt;/em&gt;, a purchase I do not regret, but this song is definitely worth the price of the vinyl. I love it when Frank sings melancholy, and this one has that quality in spades. Nostalgia, regret, and loneliness are all wrapped up in that golden bow of his amazing voice, a voice that forces your ears to attention when you hear it, never aging, never dulling, calling your life before your eyes, and all but materializing that glass of whiskey or scotch in your left hand, as your right hand reaches to pull the brim of your fedora down a little more to cover the tears in your eyes. Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>October, you have been one long, soggy mess. C&amp;rsquo;est la vie, I suppose. To commemorate what I anticipate to be tonight&amp;rsquo;s non-event, I have chosen this song to be the official &amp;ldquo;hold&amp;rdquo; music of Halloween 2018, to be played in a continuous loop until one metaphorically throws up one&amp;rsquo;s hands in disgust, and finally gives up the game. To pick it up again next year? Perhaps. But never quite in the same way.</description>

      <description>I woke up this morning with this song stuck in my head, thinking about my dad and the good progress he&amp;rsquo;s making recovering from a triple bypass operation.
I probably thought of it because I noticed it was in the repertoire of local musician Bruce Wilder, who graced us at the coffee shop one evening with his guitar.
  Here are my three favorite YouTube covers of this 1966 song by Paul Simon and Bruce Woodley.</description>

      <description>Love this song. Local musician Bruce Wilder was recently performing it solo at Firewheel Coffee, my office away from the office. Makes me want to sneak up behind him with a giant saxophone and start blaring away at the appropriate moments.
