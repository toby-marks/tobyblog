      <description>An investigation into the disappearance of Kristal Reisinger from Crestone, Colorado.&#xA;Go to the main site, or listen on Apple Podcasts.&#xA;I was unimpressed by season one, which made host Payne Lindsey podcast-famous for cracking the notoriously cold case. This one is better. And it&amp;rsquo;s set in Colorado, which has some appeal to me. You can always tell people from there. They&amp;rsquo;re windblown, so to speak.&#xA;Check it out, if you like a mystery.</description>
