      <description>I try to get out for a walk every day. I think it&amp;rsquo;s done a great deal to help maintain peace of mind, a sense of time, and a connection with my local environment. Sometimes, though, I&amp;rsquo;d like to venture a little further abroad and take in more than just the local sights. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had opportunity to do any really serious hiking like this. I wonder how long it would take to train for a five-month hike.</description>
