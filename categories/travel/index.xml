      <description>&lt;p&gt;I try to get out for a walk every day. I think it&amp;rsquo;s done a great deal to help maintain peace of mind, a sense of time, and a connection with my local environment. Sometimes, though, I&amp;rsquo;d like to venture a little further abroad and take in more than just the local sights. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had opportunity to do any &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; serious hiking like this. I wonder how long it would take to train for a five-month hike. And what would it be like to be able to totally dedicate that amount of time to an experience like that?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
