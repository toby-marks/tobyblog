      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t claim that I was one who helped to postpone the extinction. Somebody told me once as a kid that it contained pig&amp;rsquo;s brains, so I never ate it. It pretty much looked like jello&amp;rsquo;d meat, too, which didn&amp;rsquo;t add to the appeal. I&amp;rsquo;d try it today, though, if I still lived there, and probably would like it. Vinegar and pork is not a bad combo.</description>
