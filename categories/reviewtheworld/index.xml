      <description>The third and final installment of the big Zapp&amp;rsquo;s Potato Chip sampler review, representing my first donation to the blog. I&amp;rsquo;d go on to send a couple more &amp;ldquo;care packs&amp;rdquo; which would feature in a huge percentage of Brian&amp;rsquo;s output during 2014 and 2015, something of which I&amp;rsquo;m quite proud.
Highlights of this video include some of Brian&amp;rsquo;s prettier cinemagraphic work and Chris making a joke about his &amp;ldquo;bulge&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I got to know Brian in 2013 after becoming a fan of his blog, reviewtheworld.com. Toward the end of that year I sent him the first of what I would come to call &amp;ldquo;care packs&amp;rdquo; for the show ‚Äî just donated items for potential review on the site. That particular pack was a huge sampler of Zapps potato chips, a Louisiana snack of which I am quite fond. It took about six months for him to feature the first video.</description>

      <description>My first shout-out on Review the World was in this little vignette, now a classic in the RtW cinematic universe, in which &amp;ldquo;Toby&amp;rdquo; is the name of Chris&amp;rsquo;s ex-girlfriend.</description>
