	  <p>She&rsquo;s right, the <a href="https://www.littleelm.org/1110/Autumn-Fest">Little Elm Autumn Fest</a> was a blast. We went Friday on Oktoberfest night and the polka band was amazing, as were the food trucks and local craft beer. It was crowded, and we had to park a fair distance away, but we had a good time and were able to do what we went there to do. This is gonna be on our must-do list next year, but I think I&rsquo;d like to get there earlier.</p>

	  <p>I love working from shopping malls. I was just telling Kassi the other day that they offer several advantages that suit me and my work style well. Doors open early. Easy access to restrooms. Most have at least some access to power; and free wifi, though I always tether. The ambient noise is generally at an appropriate level, though my current environment has somewhat more than the usual. More than anything I appreciate the large, wide open spaces and natural light that filters in through the ceiling glass. There&rsquo;s something about that mix that enhances creativity, I think. Focuses attention. Did I mention coffee? Always access to coffee. And room, I suppose, to walk around on a short break at lunch, and interesting things to look at.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, Frank. Despite driving us crazy sometimes, you were ever a good friend and protector. I know it wasn’t you’re fault. I hope somehow you understood.</p>

<p>Arrived in beautiful Telluride, Colorado, and yes, this is my first update since day #2 of vacation. So much for my Travel Log. Between lack of cell signal and surrendering my phone to the kid, and straight up being too busy and/or exhausted, I haven’t had much opportunity for posting.</p>

<p>We’ve been busy!</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tobyblog/image/upload/a_0/v1565367158/img/C369AE06-8357-4869-915A-186467331403_h7mulf.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Back to the Grand Canyon this year, and this time we got to spend a night in the park, with a chance to do some dawn/dusk shots of the canyon itself. I can’t wait to show off some of the shots that I took, not to mention the ones that Kassi got herself, which were fairly impressive. Dinner at the El Tovar was exceptional, I have to say. Love all that dark wood. No chance for any night photography due to the cloud cover which has chased us the whole trip so far. That’s actually been a blessing, as it’s tamped down the heat a bit on what we anticipated to be the hottest parts of the trip.</p>

<p>And just like that, I’m being called away again. Time to do more stuff. Lots happened in between, including trips to Zion and Arches!</p>

<p>More updates later. Gotta run!</p>
