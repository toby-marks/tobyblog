      <description>Wishing the best of birthdays to my beloved and fellow blogger. If only it could be from Hawaii again this year. I promise to make some Mai Tais this weekend to commemorate it, and maybe post some of those pics.</description>

      <description>She&amp;rsquo;s right, the Little Elm Autumn Fest was a blast. We went Friday on Oktoberfest night and the polka band was amazing, as were the food trucks and local craft beer. It was crowded, and we had to park a fair distance away, but we had a good time and were able to do what we went there to do. This is gonna be on our must-do list next year, but I think I&amp;rsquo;d like to get there earlier.</description>

      <title>Working From Malls</title>

      <description>I love working from shopping malls. I was just telling Kassi the other day that they offer several advantages that suit me and my work style well. Doors open early. Easy access to restrooms. Most have at least some access to power; and free wifi, though I always tether. The ambient noise is generally at an appropriate level, though my current environment has somewhat more than the usual. More than anything I appreciate the large, wide open spaces and natural light that filters in through the ceiling glass.</description>

      <description>I’m sorry, Frank. Despite driving us crazy sometimes, you were ever a good friend and protector. I know it wasn’t you’re fault. I hope somehow you understood.</description>

      <description>Arrived in beautiful Telluride, Colorado, and yes, this is my first update since day #2 of vacation. So much for my Travel Log. Between lack of cell signal and surrendering my phone to the kid, and straight up being too busy and/or exhausted, I haven’t had much opportunity for posting.
We’ve been busy!
Back to the Grand Canyon this year, and this time we got to spend a night in the park, with a chance to do some dawn/dusk shots of the canyon itself.</description>

      <description>Finally made it to Red Rock State Park, and made a couple of new discoveries along the way. Our route took us through what turned out be the incredibly beautiful Coconino National Forest, a place we have vowed to return. If Tolkien’s Elves were a real thing, they might just choose to live in a place like that. Verdant green forests around the bases of giant granite mountains, interspersed all along the way with little villages and expensive looking cabin retreats, with lights hanging from the trees across bridges that span crystal clear mountain streams.</description>

      <description>On the road from Albuquerque to Flagstaff, near which we turn south to Red Rock State Park in Arizona. The kids are keen to get in a hike today, the first “real” day of our vacation, as far as I’m concerned. It’s been fun watching the younger two get excited over taking pictures from the car with the little Instax Mini. That was Kassi’s great idea. We bought Anthony around 150 exposures and his eyes got wide when I told him I wanted him to use every single one by the end of the trip.</description>

      <description>Picture of me in the Llano Estacado, Texas’s “wine country”. On the road for quite a while and still not out of the state. Holding up well. Fear the little one may be coming down with a cold. Hope he’s better after some rest.
Changed restaurant plans and will revisit our old favorite in Albuquerque for the third year in a row.
The food there has always been great, though the service is consistently slow.</description>

      <description>We’re well in to the big family road trip of 2019, and the obligatory Texas pit stop at Bucc-ees has been checked off the list. Would have sent you guys a pic from the storied Bucc-ees bathrooms, but I was too excited about these new hot n’ spicy Beaver Nuggets! You can hear all about my first experience with those glorified Corn Pops in this review I did last year with my good buddy Brian.</description>

      <description>The name of this sculpture is Entwine, I think a reference to The Lord of the Rings. It’s supposed to be a tree, or plant, to symbolize Wylie’s connection to its roots. I always thought of it as a campfire, and I think that imagery fits much better for a library.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I made a promise to myself that I would never waste time on this blog apologizing for sporadic posting. So instead of doing that, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll do that other thing where I throw a few pictures at you and catch you up on recent developments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t been following Kassi over on her personal blog, by all means go there and check it out. She&amp;rsquo;s been killing it lately, posting about all the family stuff I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be getting to over on this site, but have been too lame to do. I swear she can fire off 3 or 4 posts by the time I&amp;rsquo;m done editing the same number of photos. Practice, I guess?</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around the beginning of May (and again in the fall) the city of Richardson, Texas invites artists from across the country to gather in Cottonwood Park for a big market day celebration of beauty and imagination. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cottonwoodartfestival.com&#34;&gt;The Cottonwood Art Festival&lt;/a&gt; features some brilliant and rigorously curated talent, and is described by the artists themselves as one of the best art shows in the country. This year we decided to pay a visit as a family. And although the younger two would crap out early from the mild heat and post-rainy day humidity, we did manage to hang around just long enough for me to discover my new favorite artist, Alla Tsank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on her later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My wife Kassi recently started her own blog of a more private nature, and she&amp;rsquo;s written a wonderful article about all of the many things going on in our lives last week, including our baptism, preparation for Pascha, and the appearance of the first clusters of firewheels in Dallas. Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I woke up from a vivid dream this morning. I&amp;rsquo;d just arrived home from a business trip to California, and Kassi was very excited to show me the changes that had been made to our neighborhood in my absence. Everyone had gotten a new house, it seems, and the neighborhood itself had been newly laid out, and its boundaries expanded. Our house had been moved to the backside of the neighborhood by the creek, and the wooded area around the creek had been developed, so that our house, instead of looking out onto a wooded ravine as it would currently, was now at a &amp;ldquo;T&amp;rdquo; intersection in the middle of the larger neighborhood.</description>

      <description>Today I had a lot of reminders that there are people out there who love and care for me a great deal. My wife, parents, and children. My brothers, cousins, and family. Friends old and new. I am thankful for all of them. I am thankful for the things I have, inside and out. I am thankful for the places God has brought me to in the past year.
I met a man on the street named Emery Lambus who asked me for a couple of bucks to buy lunch.</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today is Ash Wednesday, the Catholic holy day that begins the penitential season of Lent. This year I will not be celebrating as a Catholic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year on September 1st Kassi and I, after a long season of spiritual apathy and suffering, took our first steps into the Russian Orthodox Church. There were private reasons, of course. Personal reasons that are always at the core of any conversion; but also open reasons. We did not take the step lightly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What should I say? What can I say? Perhaps a little about where I find myself these days. What I&amp;rsquo;m up to. Best keep it brief. I want to encourage myself to update these pages a little more frequently this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
