      <description>Things have become very busy for me over the last couple of weeks. I&amp;rsquo;ve been given primary streaming and video responsibilities for our church during the lockdown, all the while ramping up for a new gig at my job, and working on an interesting side project as well ‚Äî a product shoot for a friend at church who is opening up an Etsy store. (On a side note, I&amp;rsquo;ve never done anything like that and was honored that she even asked.</description>

      <title>The CV Lockdown Blues. Missing California.</title>

      <description>I suppose it can&amp;rsquo;t be helped; every year as March drags into April, as the days get hotter and the brief Texas spring looks more toward the summer, the early zeal of the Lenten discipline wears off, and the sacrifices once willingly undertaken become an annoyance and a burden. These things are only compounded by the enforced isolation and the looming prospect of an almost anti-climatic, if not mildly depressing, Pascha undertaken as it is this year without the usual joy of communal celebration.</description>

      <description>I was at the juice bar today getting an ‚ÄúImmune Booster‚Äù (beet, ginger, cayenne ‚Äî I could use it right now)‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶when I noticed this alternative
It was a cup of donuts. They were selling donuts by the cup. At the juice bar.
Today, I chose wisely.</description>

      <description>Wishing the best of birthdays to my beloved and fellow blogger. If only it could be from Hawaii again this year. I promise to make some Mai Tais this weekend to commemorate it, and maybe post some of those pics.</description>

      <description>She&amp;rsquo;s right, the Little Elm Autumn Fest was a blast. We went Friday on Oktoberfest night and the polka band was amazing, as were the food trucks and local craft beer. It was crowded, and we had to park a fair distance away, but we had a good time and were able to do what we went there to do. This is gonna be on our must-do list next year, but I think I&amp;rsquo;d like to get there earlier.</description>

      <description>I love working from shopping malls. I was just telling Kassi the other day that they offer several advantages that suit me and my work style well. Doors open early. Easy access to restrooms. Most have at least some access to power; and free wifi, though I always tether. The ambient noise is generally at an appropriate level, though my current environment has somewhat more than the usual. More than anything I appreciate the large, wide open spaces and natural light that filters in through the ceiling glass.</description>

      <description>Arrived in beautiful Telluride, Colorado, and yes, this is my first update since day #2 of vacation. So much for my Travel Log. Between lack of cell signal and surrendering my phone to the kid, and straight up being too busy and/or exhausted, I haven‚Äôt had much opportunity for posting.
We‚Äôve been busy!
Back to the Grand Canyon this year, and this time we got to spend a night in the park, with a chance to do some dawn/dusk shots of the canyon itself.</description>

      <description>Finally made it to Red Rock State Park, and made a couple of new discoveries along the way. Our route took us through what turned out be the incredibly beautiful Coconino National Forest, a place we have vowed to return. If Tolkien‚Äôs Elves were a real thing, they might just choose to live in a place like that. Verdant green forests around the bases of giant granite mountains, interspersed all along the way with little villages and expensive looking cabin retreats, with lights hanging from the trees across bridges that span crystal clear mountain streams.</description>

      <description>On the road from Albuquerque to Flagstaff, near which we turn south to Red Rock State Park in Arizona. The kids are keen to get in a hike today, the first ‚Äúreal‚Äù day of our vacation, as far as I‚Äôm concerned. It‚Äôs been fun watching the younger two get excited over taking pictures from the car with the little Instax Mini. That was Kassi‚Äôs great idea. We bought Anthony around 150 exposures and his eyes got wide when I told him I wanted him to use every single one by the end of the trip.</description>

      <description>Picture of me in the Llano Estacado, Texas‚Äôs ‚Äúwine country‚Äù. On the road for quite a while and still not out of the state. Holding up well. Fear the little one may be coming down with a cold. Hope he‚Äôs better after some rest.
Changed restaurant plans and will revisit our old favorite in Albuquerque for the third year in a row.
The food there has always been great, though the service is consistently slow.</description>

      <description>We‚Äôre well in to the big family road trip of 2019, and the obligatory Texas pit stop at Bucc-ees has been checked off the list. Would have sent you guys a pic from the storied Bucc-ees bathrooms, but I was too excited about these new hot n‚Äô spicy Beaver Nuggets! You can hear all about my first experience with those glorified Corn Pops in this review I did last year with my good buddy Brian.</description>

      <description>The name of this sculpture is Entwine, I think a reference to The Lord of the Rings. It‚Äôs supposed to be a tree, or plant, to symbolize Wylie‚Äôs connection to its roots. I always thought of it as a campfire, and I think that imagery fits much better for a library.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I made a promise to myself that I would never waste time on this blog apologizing for sporadic posting. So instead of doing that, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll do that other thing where I throw a few pictures at you and catch you up on recent developments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t been following Kassi over on her personal blog, by all means go there and check it out. She&amp;rsquo;s been killing it lately, posting about all the family stuff I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be getting to over on this site, but have been too lame to do. I swear she can fire off 3 or 4 posts by the time I&amp;rsquo;m done editing the same number of photos. Practice, I guess?</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around the beginning of May (and again in the fall) the city of Richardson, Texas invites artists from across the country to gather in Cottonwood Park for a big market day celebration of beauty and imagination. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cottonwoodartfestival.com&#34;&gt;The Cottonwood Art Festival&lt;/a&gt; features some brilliant and rigorously curated talent, and is described by the artists themselves as one of the best art shows in the country. This year we decided to pay a visit as a family. And although the younger two would crap out early from the mild heat and post-rainy day humidity, we did manage to hang around just long enough for me to discover my new favorite artist, Alla Tsank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on her later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My wife Kassi recently started her own blog of a more private nature, and she&amp;rsquo;s written a wonderful article about all of the many things going on in our lives last week, including our baptism, preparation for Pascha, and the appearance of the first clusters of firewheels in Dallas. Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I woke up from a vivid dream this morning. I&amp;rsquo;d just arrived home from a business trip to California, and Kassi was very excited to show me the changes that had been made to our neighborhood in my absence. Everyone had gotten a new house, it seems, and the neighborhood itself had been newly laid out, and its boundaries expanded. Our house had been moved to the backside of the neighborhood by the creek, and the wooded area around the creek had been developed, so that our house, instead of looking out onto a wooded ravine as it would currently, was now at a &amp;ldquo;T&amp;rdquo; intersection in the middle of the larger neighborhood.</description>

      <description>Today I had a lot of reminders that there are people out there who love and care for me a great deal. My wife, parents, and children. My brothers, cousins, and family. Friends old and new. I am thankful for all of them. I am thankful for the things I have, inside and out. I am thankful for the places God has brought me to in the past year.
I met a man on the street named Emery Lambus who asked me for a couple of bucks to buy lunch.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today is Ash Wednesday, the Catholic holy day that begins the penitential season of Lent. This year I will not be celebrating as a Catholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year on September 1st Kassi and I, after a long season of spiritual apathy and suffering, took our first steps into the Russian Orthodox Church. There were private reasons, of course. Personal reasons that are always at the core of any conversion; but also open reasons. We did not take the step lightly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What should I say? What can I say? Perhaps a little about where I find myself these days. What I&amp;rsquo;m up to. Best keep it brief. I want to encourage myself to update these pages a little more frequently this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The anticipation, that period of time I like to call &amp;ldquo;the run-up to the countdown&amp;rdquo;, starts to build throughout August, so that by the time this event rolls around Kassi and the kids and I are practically bursting with Halloween excitement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Today I mowed the back yard for the first time this spring. I am behind. The weather and other duties had kept me off task. The grass was high, and each square foot I tread into submission was like a territory reclaimed for civilization.
I asked myself when people started doing this whole thing. Exactly how old is the time honored American activity of mowing the lawn? And why is this mundane chore, as therapeutic and contemplative as it is, not shown more love by those in the Big Nostalgia set, so connected as it is to real childhood and adolescent memory?</description>

      <description>And the Toby for Outstanding Building of the Year goes to‚Ä¶ (Cut to rival building management teams dressed up in tuxedos, sitting on the edge of their seats.)
Makes me wonder what a Toby looks like. Today, too sick to care.</description>

      <description>You have unlocked secret bonus content!
Welcome to this retroactively inserted yearly retrospective. The date I am writing this is actually December 30, 2020. If you&amp;rsquo;ve found this page, that means you&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon some content that, while genuinely old, was not originally posted on this date. Greetings from the future! Or something. I suppose I could make some joke right now warning you to &amp;ldquo;turn back&amp;rdquo; from the dread year 2020, but that whole bit seems tired and depressing.</description>

&lt;p&gt;September 29th is the feast of St. Michael the Archangel, or Michaelmas as it is known in European countries. St. Michael cast the devil out of heaven, and is the commander of the armies of God. He is traditionally shown fighting a dragon, or with his foot on the back of the devil. He is the patron of soldiers and police officers, but also of the ill and suffering. He has appeared to people at various times curing diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This year I attended Texas Frightmare Weekend for the first time. By now it seems like forever ago. But lucky you ‚Äî I saved all the pictures! So here they are without much verbal adornment, or it&amp;rsquo;d probably take me another month and a half to get this up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Can we stop calling Texas Frightmare Weekend a ‚Äúregional con‚Äù now? The first reader I met this year was Aaron from Australia, who had flown all the way here to experience TFW as his &lt;em&gt;FIRST&lt;/em&gt; con.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Once again we were proud to host buddy Brian Hammons of the food/candy/retro/life blog Review the World as he made his way down to Dallas for the big UFC 185 fight night. What a weekend! Among other things, I introduced Brian Hammons to some of the best tacos in the COUNTRY. Go see what resulted over on reviewtheworld.com.</description>

      <description>Being a fan of post-Christmas year end wrap-ups, I decided to create a Flickr set highlighting some of the events and activities that filled our lives this year. These are not my best photos or even my favorites, but just a (largish) collection of pictures that capture the essence of 2014 for me. A little bit of countryside, a little bit of life at home. One or two guest appearances.</description>

His site is a surprisingly deep personal catalog that is as much a call to action and personal philosophical movement as anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I took the kids to the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;http://retropalooza.net/&#34;&gt;Retropalooza&lt;/a&gt; convention in Arlington, Texas, and boy did we have a blast! There were loads and loads of dealer tables with some very cool nostalgia items on display, classic and rare games galore, cosplayers, and even a few YouTube celebrities. Take a look at some of the fun things we discovered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about being a dad to small kids is that you always have a built-in excuse to be in the toy aisle. And if you have your kids with you then nobody looks twice at you as you gawk at all the amazing stuff on the store shelves these days. We are living in a golden age for toys and board games. Sure, there were a lot of really cool toys that I miss from the seventies and eighties that I wish my kids had a chance to experience, but today&amp;rsquo;s market offers a certain quality and vast variety of toys and other amusements that the old days could never touch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping you guys get out and sweat a bit this summer. Enjoy the late evenings while you can! DST. What a gift from Mr. Nixon!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like geocaching for lots of reasons. I like to be outside. I like discovering new places. I like walking and connecting with nature. But occasionally I learn something as well. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s just local historical trivia, or maybe a geography lesson. But sometimes the lesson is more personal, and as in this case, tragic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning started out with a trip to the Trinity Trails in Wylie, Texas for some hiking and caching. We chose to start at the easternmost trailhead, which was also the closest to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a little marina at the trailhead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m celebrating a major personal milestone today, and I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a more fitting way to commemorate it on this site than by encouraging you all to watch one of my favorite episodes of The Ray Bradbury Theater from 1989, The Wonderful Death of Dudley Stone. This episode is indeed all about decisions, priorities, and focusing on what&amp;rsquo;s important in life.

      <description>My name is Toby.
In the spring of 2013 I discovered Brian Hammons&#39; blog Review the World, and something inside clicked. Here was a guy ‚Äî just slightly my junior ‚Äî getting out and enjoying life with his friends, exploring his local environment, and generally on fire with all the possibilities that an ordinary life offers to those who know how to look for them. I had spent the bulk of 2012 doing all of those things with my two older kids while my wife was, for the most part (and regrettably), stuck at home working and/or gestating.</description>
