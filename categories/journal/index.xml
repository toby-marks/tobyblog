These things are only compounded by the enforced isolation and the looming prospect of an almost anti-climatic, if not mildly depressing, Pascha undertaken as it is this year without the usual joy of communal celebration.</description>

      <description>He&amp;rsquo;s not a fan of the new Joker, though he greatly admires Nolan&amp;rsquo;s version.
 The truth is in your mask. The truth is in what you are doing.
 Interesting take.
 Paradoxically, a mask means I can be who I really am.
 His point, based in some psychological theory, is that our plain faces are the real masks; that in our normal lives we artificially conform ourselves because of social convention, expectations, etc; but that &amp;ldquo;our mask&amp;rdquo; allows us to break out of those restrictions, inviting the true self ‚Äì¬†the inner or even unconscious self ‚Äì to emerge.</description>

      <description>She&amp;rsquo;s right, the Little Elm Autumn Fest was a blast. We went Friday on Oktoberfest night and the polka band was amazing, as were the food trucks and local craft beer. It was crowded, and we had to park a fair distance away, but we had a good time and were able to do what we went there to do. This is gonna be on our must-do list next year, but I think I&amp;rsquo;d like to get there earlier.</description>

  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LWJYaep-0sg&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these were taken from the huge catalog of templates over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stoneykins.com/&#34;&gt;Stoneykins.com&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority of which are pretty cool and definitely not useless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>One of my earliest memories is asking my mom to borrow an old Hallmark music box that played this song. It was important to me, though I couldn&amp;rsquo;t explain why. I&amp;rsquo;d listen to it over and over again, long past the point of annoyance to everyone. Sometimes at night, when I was scared, I&amp;rsquo;d listen to it to help me sleep. It has a sad, but sweet melody. At about 2:00 it has the proper timing, then very quickly starts to unwind.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Time does take its toll on the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you see when you look into a funhouse mirror? Another &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; staring out at you beneath the surface of the glass? &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; you are really just one of a whole army of such &amp;ldquo;you&amp;quot;s, none knowing for sure what side of the glass he falls on. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; you are now is just another picture frozen in time; something separate and distinct from all your past and future selves. Always dying, always being born; every thought and action carving its mark forever into the lines of your face and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine an app on your phone that would let you peer into that funhouse ‚Äî¬†would let you see those possibilities, those infinite &amp;ldquo;you&amp;quot;s that could have been. That &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, particularly those possibilities that involve you growing a beard, dying your hair, looking like a douchebag, or getting really old.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Who&amp;rsquo;s ready for fall?
You can count me in, though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure &amp;ldquo;ready&amp;rdquo; is the best word for it. Summer seemed to pass by so fast this year. Barely had time to really enjoy it, it seems, before it&amp;rsquo;s practically gone. They say this happens as you get older, but I suspect in my case it has more to do with a dearth of time spent outside this year, soaking up sun and heat.</description>

      <description>I love working from shopping malls. I was just telling Kassi the other day that they offer several advantages that suit me and my work style well. Doors open early. Easy access to restrooms. Most have at least some access to power; and free wifi, though I always tether. The ambient noise is generally at an appropriate level, though my current environment has somewhat more than the usual. More than anything I appreciate the large, wide open spaces and natural light that filters in through the ceiling glass.</description>

      <description>I always considered those things the grossest of the gross. But did get me thinking about alternative &amp;ldquo;comfortable&amp;rdquo; materials. A gel toilet seat? Cushion of air? Water? Yeah, like a water bed ‚Äî but instead it&amp;rsquo;s a toilet seat.
And if you don&amp;rsquo;t already follow the bro-science blog of Dollar Shave Club, you should. Way better than The Onion these days.</description>

      <description>That feeling when you neglect to hold the elevator for someone, but somehow they manage to press the button at the very last moment, and they know what the hell you just did, and you have to ride up several floors together in awkward silence.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve visited a few spots with some potential for accidents, but so far my worst vacation injuries have been banging my head on the roof of the car unloading luggage (last year; my neck was sore for days), and scraping up my arm pretty bad after tripping over luggage in the dark (last night). It seems I have a problem with luggage.</description>

      <description>Arrived in beautiful Telluride, Colorado, and yes, this is my first update since day #2 of vacation. So much for my Travel Log. Between lack of cell signal and surrendering my phone to the kid, and straight up being too busy and/or exhausted, I haven‚Äôt had much opportunity for posting.
We‚Äôve been busy!
Back to the Grand Canyon this year, and this time we got to spend a night in the park, with a chance to do some dawn/dusk shots of the canyon itself.</description>

      <description>Finally made it to Red Rock State Park, and made a couple of new discoveries along the way. Our route took us through what turned out be the incredibly beautiful Coconino National Forest, a place we have vowed to return. If Tolkien‚Äôs Elves were a real thing, they might just choose to live in a place like that. Verdant green forests around the bases of giant granite mountains, interspersed all along the way with little villages and expensive looking cabin retreats, with lights hanging from the trees across bridges that span crystal clear mountain streams.</description>

      <description>On the road from Albuquerque to Flagstaff, near which we turn south to Red Rock State Park in Arizona. The kids are keen to get in a hike today, the first ‚Äúreal‚Äù day of our vacation, as far as I‚Äôm concerned. It‚Äôs been fun watching the younger two get excited over taking pictures from the car with the little Instax Mini. That was Kassi‚Äôs great idea. We bought Anthony around 150 exposures and his eyes got wide when I told him I wanted him to use every single one by the end of the trip.</description>

      <description>Picture of me in the Llano Estacado, Texas‚Äôs ‚Äúwine country‚Äù. On the road for quite a while and still not out of the state. Holding up well. Fear the little one may be coming down with a cold. Hope he‚Äôs better after some rest.
Changed restaurant plans and will revisit our old favorite in Albuquerque for the third year in a row.
The food there has always been great, though the service is consistently slow.</description>

      <description>We‚Äôre well in to the big family road trip of 2019, and the obligatory Texas pit stop at Bucc-ees has been checked off the list. Would have sent you guys a pic from the storied Bucc-ees bathrooms, but I was too excited about these new hot n‚Äô spicy Beaver Nuggets! You can hear all about my first experience with those glorified Corn Pops in this review I did last year with my good buddy Brian.</description>

      <description>The name of this sculpture is Entwine, I think a reference to The Lord of the Rings. It‚Äôs supposed to be a tree, or plant, to symbolize Wylie‚Äôs connection to its roots. I always thought of it as a campfire, and I think that imagery fits much better for a library.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I made a promise to myself that I would never waste time on this blog apologizing for sporadic posting. So instead of doing that, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll do that other thing where I throw a few pictures at you and catch you up on recent developments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t been following Kassi over on her personal blog, by all means go there and check it out. She&amp;rsquo;s been killing it lately, posting about all the family stuff I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to be getting to over on this site, but have been too lame to do. I swear she can fire off 3 or 4 posts by the time I&amp;rsquo;m done editing the same number of photos. Practice, I guess?</description>

      <description>One wonders how one gets to be a known walker. Do you introduce yourself? Do you have to register at the office? Are there name tags?
In any event, I would love to get my hands on that (presumably massive) unknown mall walker dossier down at the precinct. Must be how they break in the rookie detectives.</description>

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs no denying we live in troubled times in this country. Shared celebrations are a respite from the hate that seems set to smother our culture. They also serve as milestones, reminding us of the passage of time and providing a useful historical perspective on our own lives and the times we share with each other. For our part, we plan to celebrate like we haven‚Äôt in a while, venturing down to the mall later for the big party, then fireworks later tonight. Before that I‚Äôll be grilling pizzas in the backyard, and I hope to get a lot of today on camera.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t claim that I was one who helped to postpone the extinction. Somebody told me once as a kid that it contained pig&amp;rsquo;s brains, so I never ate it. It pretty much looked like jello&amp;rsquo;d meat, too, which didn&amp;rsquo;t add to the appeal. I&amp;rsquo;d try it today, though, if I still lived there, and probably would like it. Vinegar and pork is not a bad combo.</description>

      <description>üêú‚ù§Ô∏è‚òïÔ∏è
Ants are my favorite insect. That they have actually been observed to plant coffee seeds, live in and among the plants they grow, and actually harvest the beans floors me with wonder for these remarkable creatures that are so different from us, yet so much resemble us in our social behaviors. This is real agriculture; and we already know they practice ranching and husbandry behaviors, with aphids for example ‚Äî &amp;ldquo;milking&amp;rdquo; them of the dew produced by their bodies.</description>

      <description>I live in Dallas and tonight was the first time I have ever seen anyone wearing a #MAGA hat out in public. Some old guy at Lowes. Just thought I should document that for posterity. And no, he did not appear to be buying any tiki torches, nor was his heart very obviously consumed with hatred for brown people, so as to make me hate him. Just an old man.</description>

      <description>There are only a handful of stores left standing now at Collin Creek Mall in Plano. It‚Äôll all be torn down soon. I‚Äôve worked many mornings from the food court there, just me and the old folks who walk the mall and meet up for coffee.
The mall is being razed to build a new billion dollar open air, multi-use development that will host stores, apartments, green space, and even a &amp;ldquo;lagoon&amp;rdquo; of all things.</description>

      <description>In trying to recall the name of my new favorite artist after the Cottonwood show, I somehow misremembered her name as ‚ÄúAlyssa Stank‚Äù, which I actually googled. Alyssa Stank. That could be a name. Right?</description>

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around the beginning of May (and again in the fall) the city of Richardson, Texas invites artists from across the country to gather in Cottonwood Park for a big market day celebration of beauty and imagination. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cottonwoodartfestival.com&#34;&gt;The Cottonwood Art Festival&lt;/a&gt; features some brilliant and rigorously curated talent, and is described by the artists themselves as one of the best art shows in the country. This year we decided to pay a visit as a family. And although the younger two would crap out early from the mild heat and post-rainy day humidity, we did manage to hang around just long enough for me to discover my new favorite artist, Alla Tsank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on her later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>First off, this. Nostalgia community, we need to have a deep and confronting conversation. It‚Äôs time to stop pretending you like The Golden Girls. Nobody but your grandma liked The Golden Girls, and that‚Äôs exactly as it should be. Your unnatural determination to make The Golden Girls a ‚Äúthing‚Äù amongst thirty-something males has led to this abomination, and it‚Äôs time we as a society put an end to this madness.</description>

      <description>I woke up from a vivid dream this morning. I&amp;rsquo;d just arrived home from a business trip to California, and Kassi was very excited to show me the changes that had been made to our neighborhood in my absence. Everyone had gotten a new house, it seems, and the neighborhood itself had been newly laid out, and its boundaries expanded. Our house had been moved to the backside of the neighborhood by the creek, and the wooded area around the creek had been developed, so that our house, instead of looking out onto a wooded ravine as it would currently, was now at a &amp;ldquo;T&amp;rdquo; intersection in the middle of the larger neighborhood.</description>

      <description>You would think that in this &amp;ldquo;woke&amp;rdquo; era the comedies of Norman Lear would be better appreciated, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think his many efforts to reboot his old series are going anywhere. Not because of any politically touchy subject matter, but because he saw the humanity in all of his characters, including those like Archie Bunker who he used to illustrate everything he saw as wrong with modern American attitudes, but whom he based on his own beloved father.</description>

      <description>A cappuccino is a wonderful way to start the morning. Though this morning I can say I‚Äôve had better. There was a guy here who had one of those ironic mustaches. He could make good coffee. I wonder where he went. And if he still has that mustache. And if he left, maybe, to startup some better place that specializes in morning cappuccinos? And where that place might be, and if they have WiFi?</description>

      <description>That‚Äôs a wrap for this trip. It‚Äôs been fun trying a new hotel and exploring a different part of the city. Perhaps next time I‚Äôll try to take in more of the cultural life. There‚Äôs always something going on in Pasadena.
Now home again to Texas and the people I love. See you soon!</description>

      <description>The interesting things you run across when you decide to walk the mile and a half back to the hotel instead of Uber-ing. This is an old Methodist Church in the Playhouse District of Pasadena. Almost looks like an entrance to another world. A secret garden. A little foreboding perhaps.
There was a lot about this area I‚Äôd like to explore. I‚Äôll be back again.</description>

      <description>Today in church I prostrated myself, whuch is to say I bowed deeply, with knees and forehead touching the floor, to my spiritual fathers and to every single other person present, and asked forgiveness for the things I have done that caused them offense. And they in turn asked me. The little kids. The old folks. My personal friends, and people to whom I&amp;rsquo;ve never spoken a word. We forgave each other, and reminded each other that God forgives.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today is Ash Wednesday, the Catholic holy day that begins the penitential season of Lent. This year I will not be celebrating as a Catholic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year on September 1st Kassi and I, after a long season of spiritual apathy and suffering, took our first steps into the Russian Orthodox Church. There were private reasons, of course. Personal reasons that are always at the core of any conversion; but also open reasons. We did not take the step lightly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had this song stuck in my head for a couple of days, and maybe if I post it I can get rid of it. It&amp;rsquo;s from The Jerk, and features Bernadette Peters, my first screen crush when I was just a little kid. That bit at the end where she pulls out the coronet still cracks me up. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s a touching scene, don&amp;rsquo;t you think? A little reminder that life can be sweet sometimes.</description>

      <description>Infexxion is an iPhone game based on the old arcade game Attax. My cousin Carl introduced me to it. There was a cabinet in the lobby of a (surely long-since demolished?) movie theater in what is now a rough part of Lafayette, Louisiana. I forget what we were seeing that night. He played ‚Äî I didn&amp;rsquo;t, as I recall. It had a weird, edgy kind of quality to it, like an Exidy game.</description>

      <description>The Sonic the Hedgehog movie comes out this year.
Are you hyped, nostalgia boys?!
Because if you look at this poster and get hyped, I&amp;rsquo;m calling the cops. Seriously, who designed this freakish movie poster and why is he/she not in jail/hell?</description>

      <description>Yesterday the kid was watching an episode of the old Ghostbusters cartoon from the 80s, his new favorite on Netflix. The show featured the three Fates, and a journey to the Underworld, crossing the river Styx, etc. I said to him &amp;ldquo;Did you know this is Greek mythology? These were things the ancient Greeks believed.&amp;rdquo; He looked at me incredulously for a second and asked &amp;ldquo;They believed in the Ghostbusters?&amp;rdquo; ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</description>

      <description>Even if Francis is a liberal, it is far from clear to us that the proper response is liberalism. This, then, is the crux of the problem. Barring the Head of the Church returning, there will be other popes. Perhaps some will be, in the words of the great Louisiana philosopher and theologian I.J. Reilly, good authoritarian popes. Perhaps some will be liberals. However, the anti-liberal position works as well with a good authoritarian pope as it does with a liberal pope.</description>

      <title>A Frank Zappa Halloween Costume</title>

      <description>I think I just found my Halloween costume for this year.
How did I ever miss this? It debuted just last year for the 40th anniversary celebration of Frank Zappa&amp;rsquo;s legendary Halloween concert series at The Palladium in New York. Zappa did Halloween concerts throughout the entirety of his career, but the one in 1977 is generally considered to be the apogee of that grand tradition.
To commemorate that series of shows (which ran from October 28-31), the family released a massive box set that includes all six concerts on a USB stick, in 24-bit WAV audio for a flawless sound experience, PLUS a jaw-dropping adult size Frank Zappa costume in vintage 70s plastic style.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Normally scheduled in late August, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://halloweenandhaunt.com/&#34; title=&#34;The Halloween &amp;amp; Hauntfest Show&#34;&gt;Halloween &amp;amp; Hauntfest show&lt;/a&gt; is appropriately billed as &amp;ldquo;a gateway event to the Halloween season.&amp;rdquo; To those of us who kick off our official celebrations with the start of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dinosaurdracula.com/&#34;&gt;Dinosaur Dracula&amp;rsquo;s Halloween Countdown&lt;/a&gt; on September 1, the timing hits that perfect sweet spot. The anticipation, that period of time I like to call &amp;ldquo;the run-up to the countdown&amp;rdquo;, starts to build throughout August, so that by the time this event rolls around Kassi and the kids and I are practically bursting with Halloween excitement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Today I mowed the back yard for the first time this spring. I am behind. The weather and other duties had kept me off task. The grass was high, and each square foot I tread into submission was like a territory reclaimed for civilization.
I asked myself when people started doing this whole thing. Exactly how old is the time honored American activity of mowing the lawn? And why is this mundane chore, as therapeutic and contemplative as it is, not shown more love by those in the Big Nostalgia set, so connected as it is to real childhood and adolescent memory?</description>

      <description>You have unlocked secret bonus content!
Welcome to this retroactively inserted yearly retrospective. The date I am writing this is actually December 30, 2020. If you&amp;rsquo;ve found this page, that means you&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon some content that, while genuinely old, was not originally posted on this date. Greetings from the future! Or something. I suppose I could make some joke right now warning you to &amp;ldquo;turn back&amp;rdquo; from the dread year 2020, but that whole bit seems tired and depressing.</description>

&lt;p&gt;September 29th is the feast of St. Michael the Archangel, or Michaelmas as it is known in European countries. St. Michael cast the devil out of heaven, and is the commander of the armies of God. He is traditionally shown fighting a dragon, or with his foot on the back of the devil. He is the patron of soldiers and police officers, but also of the ill and suffering. He has appeared to people at various times curing diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Being a fan of post-Christmas year end wrap-ups, I decided to create a Flickr set highlighting some of the events and activities that filled our lives this year. These are not my best photos or even my favorites, but just a (largish) collection of pictures that capture the essence of 2014 for me. A little bit of countryside, a little bit of life at home. One or two guest appearances.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Those of you paying &lt;a href=&#34;http://tobyblog.com/posts/20140202-the-beginning/&#34;&gt;close attention&lt;/a&gt; will remember that Tobyblog owes its existence to my good buddy Brian Hammons of the nostalgia blog &lt;a href=&#34;http://reviewtheworld.com/&#34;&gt;reviewtheworld.com&lt;/a&gt;. His site is a surprisingly deep personal catalog that is as much a call to action and personal philosophical movement as anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I took the kids to the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;http://retropalooza.net/&#34;&gt;Retropalooza&lt;/a&gt; convention in Arlington, Texas, and boy did we have a blast! There were loads and loads of dealer tables with some very cool nostalgia items on display, classic and rare games galore, cosplayers, and even a few YouTube celebrities. Take a look at some of the fun things we discovered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Visit To The Toy Store</title>

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about being a dad to small kids is that you always have a built-in excuse to be in the toy aisle. And if you have your kids with you then nobody looks twice at you as you gawk at all the amazing stuff on the store shelves these days. We are living in a golden age for toys and board games. Sure, there were a lot of really cool toys that I miss from the seventies and eighties that I wish my kids had a chance to experience, but today&amp;rsquo;s market offers a certain quality and vast variety of toys and other amusements that the old days could never touch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not sure if I like the new mascot. He tried to eat the baby&amp;rsquo;s noony.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Technically spotted on July 1 at Michaels. Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://swaggermomtales.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Swagger Mom&lt;/a&gt; for the tip-off about fall going up this week. That made me wonder, and my suspicions checked out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s already here. My woodland trekking has been sidelined a bit due to having to nurse a sumac rash, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be back soon enough. Here&amp;rsquo;s hoping you guys get out and sweat a bit this summer. Enjoy the late evenings while you can! DST. What a gift from Mr. Nixon!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like geocaching for lots of reasons. I like to be outside. I like discovering new places. I like walking and connecting with nature. But occasionally I learn something as well. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s just local historical trivia, or maybe a geography lesson. But sometimes the lesson is more personal, and as in this case, tragic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning started out with a trip to the Trinity Trails in Wylie, Texas for some hiking and caching. We chose to start at the easternmost trailhead, which was also the closest to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a little marina at the trailhead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m celebrating a major personal milestone today, and I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a more fitting way to commemorate it on this site than by encouraging you all to watch one of my favorite episodes of The Ray Bradbury Theater from 1989, The Wonderful Death of Dudley Stone. This episode is indeed all about decisions, priorities, and focusing on what&amp;rsquo;s important in life.

      <description>My name is Toby.
In the spring of 2013 I discovered Brian Hammons&#39; blog Review the World, and something inside clicked. Here was a guy ‚Äî just slightly my junior ‚Äî getting out and enjoying life with his friends, exploring his local environment, and generally on fire with all the possibilities that an ordinary life offers to those who know how to look for them. I had spent the bulk of 2012 doing all of those things with my two older kids while my wife was, for the most part (and regrettably), stuck at home working and/or gestating.</description>
