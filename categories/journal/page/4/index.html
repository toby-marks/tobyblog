	  <p>The name of this sculpture is Entwine, I think a reference to The Lord of the Rings. It’s supposed to be a tree, or plant, to symbolize Wylie’s connection to its roots. I always thought of it as a campfire, and I think that imagery fits much better for a library.</p>

<p>I made a promise to myself that I would never waste time on this blog apologizing for sporadic posting. So instead of doing that, I think I&rsquo;ll do that other thing where I throw a few pictures at you and catch you up on recent developments.</p>

	  <p>If you haven&rsquo;t been following Kassi over on her personal blog, by all means go there and check it out. She&rsquo;s been killing it lately, posting about all the family stuff I&rsquo;m supposed to be getting to over on this site, but have been too lame to do. I swear she can fire off 3 or 4 posts by the time I&rsquo;m done editing the same number of photos. Practice, I guess? Her latest one about the John Muir books she&rsquo;s been collecting has put me in a very vacation-y kind of mood. I thought it was funny that she called me out for still working on photos from two years ago, which is true. But I have learned (what I think is) a whole lot in the meantime, and my camera and software suite, and hopefully my editing sensibilities, have evolved a great deal in that time. It&rsquo;s been fun revisiting those not-so-old photos and reminiscing on the times we spent out on the road in some very rugged country. I&rsquo;d honestly forgotten just how pretty it was up in Colorado the summer of 2017. Anyway, enjoy the blog and hopefully get inspired yourself. John Muir was a great man, one of this nation&rsquo;s finest. And more to come here on all that as well.</p>

<p>Somewhere around the beginning of May (and again in the fall) the city of Richardson, Texas invites artists from across the country to gather in Cottonwood Park for a big market day celebration of beauty and imagination. <a href="https://www.cottonwoodartfestival.com">The Cottonwood Art Festival</a> features some brilliant and rigorously curated talent, and is described by the artists themselves as one of the best art shows in the country. This year we decided to pay a visit as a family. And although the younger two would crap out early from the mild heat and post-rainy day humidity, we did manage to hang around just long enough for me to discover my new favorite artist, Alla Tsank.</p>
<p>More on her later.</p>
