	  <p>She&rsquo;s right, the <a href="https://www.littleelm.org/1110/Autumn-Fest">Little Elm Autumn Fest</a> was a blast. We went Friday on Oktoberfest night and the polka band was amazing, as were the food trucks and local craft beer. It was crowded, and we had to park a fair distance away, but we had a good time and were able to do what we went there to do. This is gonna be on our must-do list next year, but I think I&rsquo;d like to get there earlier.</p>

	  <p>One of my earliest memories is asking my mom to borrow an old Hallmark music box that played this song. It was important to me, though I couldn&rsquo;t explain why. I&rsquo;d listen to it over and over again, long past the point of annoyance to everyone. Sometimes at night, when I was scared, I&rsquo;d listen to it to help me sleep. It has a sad, but sweet melody. At about 2:00 it has the proper timing, then very quickly starts to unwind. It becomes sort of haunting, which is most likely why I remember it. It was lost for many years. I have some memory of finding it once in my early teen years. I took it apart, played some with the mechanism, then lost it again. Who knows where those things go when they&rsquo;re gone. I suppose it&rsquo;s rotting in some garbage pile now, but there&rsquo;s a possibility it may be buried in our old yard.</p>

<p>Time does take its toll on the body.</p>
<p>What do you see when you look into a funhouse mirror? Another &ldquo;you&rdquo; staring out at you beneath the surface of the glass? <em><strong>Maybe</strong></em> you are really just one of a whole army of such &ldquo;you&quot;s, none knowing for sure what side of the glass he falls on. <em><strong>Maybe</strong></em> the &ldquo;you&rdquo; you are now is just another picture frozen in time; something separate and distinct from all your past and future selves. Always dying, always being born; every thought and action carving its mark forever into the lines of your face and body.</p>
<p>Now imagine an app on your phone that would let you peer into that funhouse — would let you see those possibilities, those infinite &ldquo;you&quot;s that could have been. That <em><strong>will</strong></em> be?</p>
<p>Well, particularly those possibilities that involve you growing a beard, dying your hair, looking like a douchebag, or getting really old.</p>
