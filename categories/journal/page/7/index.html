<p><em><strong>Who&rsquo;s ready for fall?</strong></em></p>
<p>You can count me in, though I&rsquo;m not sure &ldquo;ready&rdquo; is the best word for it. Summer seemed to pass by so fast this year. Barely had time to really <em>enjoy</em> it, it seems, before it&rsquo;s practically gone. They say this happens as you get older, but I suspect in my case it has more to do with a dearth of time spent outside this year, soaking up sun and heat. That kind of thing has a way of slowing down clock and calendar. Try it and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean.</p>
<p>Nevertheless we <em>did</em> get out to see some fairly amazing things in the past few weeks, which I&rsquo;m very keen to show you. I took an awful lot of pics during our three days at the Grand Canyon, which was our next stop after <a href="http://tobyblog.com/photos/20190817-red-rock-state-park/">Red Rock</a>, and I&rsquo;m quite satisified with them overall. We booked both the sunset and sunrise bus tours, and although that was a mixed bag for me due to an amateurish camera setting screwup, I still managed to get some impressive photos of the canyon, far better than last year&rsquo;s set.</p>
<p>What made me happiest, though, was the opportunity to photograph some of the canyon ravens and crows up close this time, thanks to my P1000 and its powerful zoom lens. I edited this one especially to hang up on our wall during the Halloween season.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping for a better one this year.</p>

	  <p>I love working from shopping malls. I was just telling Kassi the other day that they offer several advantages that suit me and my work style well. Doors open early. Easy access to restrooms. Most have at least some access to power; and free wifi, though I always tether. The ambient noise is generally at an appropriate level, though my current environment has somewhat more than the usual. More than anything I appreciate the large, wide open spaces and natural light that filters in through the ceiling glass. There&rsquo;s something about that mix that enhances creativity, I think. Focuses attention. Did I mention coffee? Always access to coffee. And room, I suppose, to walk around on a short break at lunch, and interesting things to look at.</p>

	  <p>I always considered those things the grossest of the gross. But did get me thinking about alternative &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; materials. A gel toilet seat? Cushion of air? Water? Yeah, like a water bed — but instead it&rsquo;s a toilet seat.</p>
