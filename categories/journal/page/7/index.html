	  <p>I can&rsquo;t claim that I was one who helped to postpone the extinction. Somebody told me once as a kid that it contained pig&rsquo;s brains, so I never ate it. It pretty much looked like jello&rsquo;d meat, too, which didn&rsquo;t add to the appeal. I&rsquo;d try it today, though, if I still lived there, and probably would like it. Vinegar and pork is not a bad combo.</p>

<p>Ants are my favorite insect. That they have actually been observed to plant coffee seeds, live in and among the plants they grow, and actually harvest the beans floors me with wonder for these remarkable creatures that are so different from us, yet so much resemble us in our social behaviors. This is real agriculture; and we already know they practice ranching and husbandry behaviors, with aphids for example ‚Äî &ldquo;milking&rdquo; them of the dew produced by their bodies. That <strong>coffee</strong> is what they go for makes me love them even more.</p>
<p>But the article also tells a remarkable story about a South American farmer trying to learn from nature, in a way that hurts him financially, but that he thinks is important for his country and for the future. We&rsquo;d never know these things were it not for people like that. And who knows what else there is yet to discover.</p>

<p>Somewhere around the beginning of May (and again in the fall) the city of Richardson, Texas invites artists from across the country to gather in Cottonwood Park for a big market day celebration of beauty and imagination. <a href="https://www.cottonwoodartfestival.com">The Cottonwood Art Festival</a> features some brilliant and rigorously curated talent, and is described by the artists themselves as one of the best art shows in the country. This year we decided to pay a visit as a family. And although the younger two would crap out early from the mild heat and post-rainy day humidity, we did manage to hang around just long enough for me to discover my new favorite artist, Alla Tsank.</p>
<p>More on her later.</p>

	  <p>My wife Kassi recently started her own blog of a more private nature, and she&rsquo;s written a wonderful article about all of the many things going on in our lives last week, including our baptism, preparation for Pascha, and the appearance of the first clusters of firewheels in Dallas. Take a look.</p>

	  I woke up from a vivid dream this morning. I&rsquo;d just arrived home from a business trip to California, and Kassi was very excited to show me the changes that had been made to our neighborhood in my absence. Everyone had gotten a new house, it seems, and the neighborhood itself had been newly laid out, and its boundaries expanded. Our house had been moved to the backside of the neighborhood by the creek, and the wooded area around the creek had been developed, so that our house, instead of looking out onto a wooded ravine as it would currently, was now at a &ldquo;T&rdquo; intersection in the middle of the larger neighborhood.
