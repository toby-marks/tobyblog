<p>Technically spotted on July 1 at Michaels. Thanks to <a href="http://swaggermomtales.blogspot.com/">Swagger Mom</a> for the tip-off about fall going up this week. That made me wonder, and my suspicions checked out.</p>

<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s already here. My woodland trekking has been sidelined a bit due to having to nurse a sumac rash, but I&rsquo;ll be back soon enough. Here&rsquo;s hoping you guys get out and sweat a bit this summer. Enjoy the late evenings while you can! DST. What a gift from Mr. Nixon!</p>

	  <p>I like geocaching for lots of reasons. I like to be outside. I like discovering new places. I like walking and connecting with nature. But occasionally I learn something as well. Usually it&rsquo;s just local historical trivia, or maybe a geography lesson. But sometimes the lesson is more personal, and as in this case, tragic.</p>
<p>The morning started out with a trip to the Trinity Trails in Wylie, Texas for some hiking and caching. We chose to start at the easternmost trailhead, which was also the closest to us.</p>
<p>There was a little marina at the trailhead.</p>

	  <p>I&rsquo;m celebrating a major personal milestone today, and I can&rsquo;t think of a more fitting way to commemorate it on this site than by encouraging you all to watch one of my favorite episodes of The Ray Bradbury Theater from 1989, The Wonderful Death of Dudley Stone. This episode is indeed all about decisions, priorities, and focusing on what&rsquo;s important in life.</p>

	  <p>My name is Toby.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2013 I discovered Brian Hammons' blog <a href="http://reviewtheworldblog.blogspot.com/">Review the World</a>, and something inside clicked. Here was a guy — just slightly my junior — getting out and enjoying life with his friends, exploring his local environment, and generally on fire with all the possibilities that an ordinary life offers to those who know how to look for them. I had spent the bulk of 2012 doing all of those things with my two older kids while my wife was, for the most part (and regrettably), stuck at home working and/or gestating. It was a magic year open to all sorts of new experiences. That all ended, or seemed to, with the arrival of the new baby and all of the familiar responsibilities that went along with being a third-time father. Brian&rsquo;s videos, especially the <a href="http://reviewtheworldblog.blogspot.com/search/label/Go%20Road%20Trip">GO! Road Trip</a> series, seemed to crystalize that sense of adventure and exploration I was missing at that moment, and which I sorely missed enjoying with the kids, at least as frequently as we had grown accustomed to over the preceding year. I contacted Brian to tell him how much I liked his videos, and to encourage him to make more. And now, almost a year later, he is encouraging me to join him in this little online party.</p>
<p><em>Challenge accepted.</em></p>
<p>My intent for this site is somewhat different than Brian&rsquo;s for Review the World; that being said, I refuse to allow myself to constrain its potentialities. The site will grow organically, entertaining this or that whim or obsession, observing the seasons and responding to events. But a few core ideas will no doubt shape and permeate its essence for its natural life span, and those do not bear mentioning now, as they will become obvious soon enough.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
