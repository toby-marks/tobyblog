      <title>Cappuccino in the Morning </title>

      <description>A cappuccino is a wonderful way to start the morning. Though this morning I can say I‚Äôve had better. There was a guy here who had one of those ironic mustaches. He could make good coffee. I wonder where he went. And if he still has that mustache. And if he left, maybe, to startup some better place that specializes in morning cappuccinos? And where that place might be, and if they have WiFi?</description>

      <description>That‚Äôs a wrap for this trip. It‚Äôs been fun trying a new hotel and exploring a different part of the city. Perhaps next time I‚Äôll try to take in more of the cultural life. There‚Äôs always something going on in Pasadena.
Now home again to Texas and the people I love. See you soon!</description>

      <title>A Set of Antique Glasses</title>

      <description>I always check out the glassware in antique shops. The Greek theme doesn&amp;rsquo;t really suit me, but I thought the ornate styling was good for a pic.</description>

      <description>The interesting things you run across when you decide to walk the mile and a half back to the hotel instead of Uber-ing. This is an old Methodist Church in the Playhouse District of Pasadena. Almost looks like an entrance to another world. A secret garden. A little foreboding perhaps.
There was a lot about this area I‚Äôd like to explore. I‚Äôll be back again.</description>

      <description>Happy springtime to all you players out there. The weather‚Äôs warming up here in Texas. We‚Äôre coming out of winter. I think we‚Äôre through the worst of it. Are you looking for signs of new growth? Look to the trees! They‚Äôre always the first to show.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had this song stuck in my head for a couple of days, and maybe if I post it I can get rid of it. It&amp;rsquo;s from The Jerk, and features Bernadette Peters, my first screen crush when I was just a little kid. That bit at the end where she pulls out the coronet still cracks me up. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s a touching scene, don&amp;rsquo;t you think? A little reminder that life can be sweet sometimes.</description>

      <description>Infexxion is an iPhone game based on the old arcade game Attax. My cousin Carl introduced me to it. There was a cabinet in the lobby of a (surely long-since demolished?) movie theater in what is now a rough part of Lafayette, Louisiana. I forget what we were seeing that night. He played ‚Äî I didn&amp;rsquo;t, as I recall. It had a weird, edgy kind of quality to it, like an Exidy game.</description>

      <description>The Sonic the Hedgehog movie comes out this year.
Are you hyped, nostalgia boys?!
Because if you look at this poster and get hyped, I&amp;rsquo;m calling the cops. Seriously, who designed this freakish movie poster and why is he/she not in jail/hell?</description>
