      <description>A cappuccino is a wonderful way to start the morning. Though this morning I can say I‚Äôve had better. There was a guy here who had one of those ironic mustaches. He could make good coffee. I wonder where he went. And if he still has that mustache. And if he left, maybe, to startup some better place that specializes in morning cappuccinos? And where that place might be, and if they have WiFi?</description>

      <description>That‚Äôs a wrap for this trip. It‚Äôs been fun trying a new hotel and exploring a different part of the city. Perhaps next time I‚Äôll try to take in more of the cultural life. There‚Äôs always something going on in Pasadena.
Now home again to Texas and the people I love. See you soon!</description>
