      <title>All New Photo Galleries</title>

      <description>It took a bit of effort to get everything tweaked just right for mobile, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded my photo galleries to use the popular &amp;ldquo;lightbox&amp;rdquo; style layout. There&amp;rsquo;s of course some Javascript overhead that I regret, but I think that&amp;rsquo;s offset somewhat by lazy loading and the use of thumbnails. See whether you think response time has improved. It&amp;rsquo;s not everywhere yet, just on recent galleries like Flight to LA and probably all stuff going forward from that, unless I&amp;rsquo;m posting from my phone.</description>

      <title>🛠 Major Site Updates 👨🏻‍💻</title>
      <link>http://tobyblog.com/microposts/20190411-major-site-updates/</link>

      <description>🛠👨🏻‍💻 Major site updates! A lot of you might not be aware that in years past I made a lot of videos for the site. You&amp;rsquo;ll now notice a Videos tab up at the top to make it easy to find those. Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve settled on how I&amp;rsquo;m going to use the Microposts feature of blog, which mainly I&amp;rsquo;ll reserve for short text-only updates like these, or short Tweet-like content. As a result, I moved a lot of my Microposts for this year under Posts, which as an added benefit will allow you to comment on my photoblog stuff.</description>

      <title>🛠 Mobile Site Updates With Forestry.io 👨🏻‍💻</title>
      <link>http://tobyblog.com/microposts/20190307-mobile-site-updates-with-forestry-io/</link>

      <description>Some techno-gibberish: forestry.io offers a free CMS service that integrates with Hugo, the tool I use to generate the site. What that means is that I can now update the site from my iPhone 📱!
Hopefully that&amp;rsquo;ll allow me to do something from time to time that I&amp;rsquo;ve never done here before — real-time site updates. Capture some things in the moment before they&amp;rsquo;re lost to time and fleeting attention.</description>

      <title>Site Updates — Photoblog Previews Fixed for Mobile</title>
      <link>http://tobyblog.com/microposts/20190228-site-updates/</link>

      <description>I made a couple of site updates yesterday I wanted to mention.
Now, if you click on the logo image, you&amp;rsquo;ll be taken back to the home page.
I fixed the stylesheets for mobile devices so that the photoblog image previews work a little better and appear more consistent between small screen and large screen devices.
Remember to click on the title of a photoblog (like the recent Scenes from the LAX International Terminal) to see the full set of photos.</description>

      <title>Now you can leave comments</title>

      <description>👨🏻‍💻🛠
Just a quick site update — you can now leave comments! I had that feature back in the old days of the blog, and am only now getting around to adding it back. Hopefully it doesn&amp;rsquo;t drag the page load time down too much. Since the internal URLs for all the articles changed after I migrated the site, I unfortunately lost all those old comments. So leave me some new ones if you feel it.</description>

      <title>Problems with Flickr?</title>
      <link>http://tobyblog.com/microposts/20190207-1138-flickr-links-down/</link>

      <description>To those who may still occasionally haunt this site, this is a reminder that it&amp;rsquo;s not forgotten, just long neglected. It looks like there may some sort of problem with my Flickr embeds. I will work on repairing those shortly, so stay tuned.
Where do we go from here? That&amp;rsquo;s a question I ask myself frequently with regards to this blog. Has it lived its good life for me, and now expired?</description>
