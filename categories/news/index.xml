      <description>Deepfake. I would have preferred this use his Ace Ventura voice, but I guess the AI isn&amp;rsquo;t up to that (yet).

      <title>The Subtle Subversion of Hating Nazis</title>

      <description>It‚Äôs not a contest but every generation has to confront its own evil because there is something deeply wrong with human beings.
 The reason for the existence of shows like Hunters is the same reason why Godwin had to come up with his &amp;ldquo;Law.&amp;quot; And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to do with the laziness of screenwriters, though that does play into it. In the absence of religious faith Hitler and the Nazis have taken the place of the devil in our collective mythology.</description>

      <title>The Windows of Our Isolation</title>

      <description>Since the coronavirus started spreading, our little computer and phone cameras have become the windows of our isolation, looking into other people‚Äôs lives, catching glimpses of pets, children, and spouses in the background of video calls. I find these moments deeply humanizing; reminders that we‚Äôre not perfect work machines, just people trying to do the best we can. Our hair is messy, our faces poorly framed and lit. Sometimes we leave the mic on when we go to the bathroom.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re not waiting out the apocalypse in a treehouse hotel, you&amp;rsquo;re not doing it right. Most of these are in exotic spots around the world, but there happens to be one nearby in Eureka Springs! And very affordable, too.</description>

      <description>Crows, in fact, might be like us not so much because they are clever (and so are we) but rather because they sometimes engage their cleverness simply for fun ‚Äì and so do we.
 What&amp;rsquo;s it like to be a crow? What do they make of us? Are animals capable of moral behavior? Having been a pet owner for many years I think this is true. I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve observed it.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I got to tag along recently to an impromptu press conference called at Cook Children&amp;rsquo;s Medical Center in Ft. Worth by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.texasrighttolife.com&#34;&gt;Texas Right to Life&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.texasrighttolife.com/urgent-cook-childrens-to-pull-plug-on-9-month-baby/&#34;&gt;read about the unfortunate circumstances here&lt;/a&gt;. We were expecting Kassi to speak to the legal issues involved, but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t questioned at that time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Slavoj Zizek on The Joker</title>

      <description>He&amp;rsquo;s not a fan of the new Joker, though he greatly admires Nolan&amp;rsquo;s version.
 The truth is in your mask. The truth is in what you are doing.
 Interesting take.
 Paradoxically, a mask means I can be who I really am.
 His point, based in some psychological theory, is that our plain faces are the real masks; that in our normal lives we artificially conform ourselves because of social convention, expectations, etc; but that &amp;ldquo;our mask&amp;rdquo; allows us to break out of those restrictions, inviting the true self ‚Äì¬†the inner or even unconscious self ‚Äì to emerge.</description>

      <description>She went on: ‚ÄúI never believed the whole ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy single‚Äô spiel. I was like, ‚ÄòThis is totally spiel.‚Äô It took me a long time, but I‚Äôm very happy [being single]. I call it being self-partnered.‚Äù
 The only story here is how much Emma Watson uses the Hollywood word spiel.</description>

      <title>A History of the Puffy Toilet Seat</title>

      <description>I always considered those things the grossest of the gross. But did get me thinking about alternative &amp;ldquo;comfortable&amp;rdquo; materials. A gel toilet seat? Cushion of air? Water? Yeah, like a water bed ‚Äî but instead it&amp;rsquo;s a toilet seat.
And if you don&amp;rsquo;t already follow the bro-science blog of Dollar Shave Club, you should. Way better than The Onion these days.</description>

      <title>Do Ants Like Coffee?</title>

      <description>üêú‚ù§Ô∏è‚òïÔ∏è
Ants are my favorite insect. That they have actually been observed to plant coffee seeds, live in and among the plants they grow, and actually harvest the beans floors me with wonder for these remarkable creatures that are so different from us, yet so much resemble us in our social behaviors. This is real agriculture; and we already know they practice ranching and husbandry behaviors, with aphids for example ‚Äî &amp;ldquo;milking&amp;rdquo; them of the dew produced by their bodies.</description>
