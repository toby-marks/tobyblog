      <description>It‚Äôs not a contest but every generation has to confront its own evil because there is something deeply wrong with human beings.&#xA;The reason for the existence of shows like Hunters is the same reason why Godwin had to come up with his &amp;ldquo;Law.&amp;rdquo; And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to do with the laziness of screenwriters, though that does play into it.

      <description>Since the coronavirus started spreading, our little computer and phone cameras have become the windows of our isolation, looking into other people‚Äôs lives, catching glimpses of pets, children, and spouses in the background of video calls. I find these moments deeply humanizing; reminders that we‚Äôre not perfect work machines, just people trying to do the best we can. Our hair is messy, our faces poorly framed and lit. Sometimes we leave the mic on when we go to the bathroom.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re not waiting out the apocalypse in a treehouse hotel, you&amp;rsquo;re not doing it right. Most of these are in exotic spots around the world, but there happens to be one nearby in Eureka Springs! And very affordable, too.</description>

      <description>Crows, in fact, might be like us not so much because they are clever (and so are we) but rather because they sometimes engage their cleverness simply for fun ‚Äì and so do we.&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s it like to be a crow? What do they make of us? Are animals capable of moral behavior? Having been a pet owner for many years I think this is true. I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve observed it.</description>
