      <title>Alan Moore, Creator of The Watchmen, Says Adult Infatuation With Comic Book Superheros is Embarassing</title>

      <description>He adds the popularity of the genre among adults suggests a &amp;ldquo;kind of deliberate, self-imposed state of emotional arrest&amp;rdquo;.
And his criticism extends to creators.
He says superheroes are written and drawn by people who&amp;rsquo;ve never stood up for their own rights against the companies that employ them - saying they appear &amp;ldquo;to be largely employed as cowardice compensators&amp;rdquo;.
 I&amp;rsquo;ve made the same remark before. Not so much that it&amp;rsquo;s weird to see individual people my age obsessing over Star Wars or comic book movies or Lord of the Rings ‚Äî people after all are going to have their own quirky passions ‚Äî¬†but that it&amp;rsquo;s weird to see the entire adult culture obsessing over such things, which after all were for nerds.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I got to tag along recently to an impromptu press conference called at Cook Children&amp;rsquo;s Medical Center in Ft. Worth by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.texasrighttolife.com&#34;&gt;Texas Right to Life&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.texasrighttolife.com/urgent-cook-childrens-to-pull-plug-on-9-month-baby/&#34;&gt;read about the unfortunate circumstances here&lt;/a&gt;. We were expecting Kassi to speak to the legal issues involved, but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t questioned at that time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Slavoj Zizek on The Joker</title>

      <description>He&amp;rsquo;s not a fan of the new Joker, though he greatly admires Nolan&amp;rsquo;s version.
 The truth is in your mask. The truth is in what you are doing.
 Interesting take.
 Paradoxically, a mask means I can be who I really am.
 His point, based in some psychological theory, is that our plain faces are the real masks; that in our normal lives we artificially conform ourselves because of social convention, expectations, etc; but that &amp;ldquo;our mask&amp;rdquo; allows us to break out of those restrictions, inviting the true self ‚Äì¬†the inner or even unconscious self ‚Äì to emerge.</description>

      <description>She went on: ‚ÄúI never believed the whole ‚ÄòI‚Äôm happy single‚Äô spiel. I was like, ‚ÄòThis is totally spiel.‚Äô It took me a long time, but I‚Äôm very happy [being single]. I call it being self-partnered.‚Äù
 The only story here is how much Emma Watson uses the Hollywood word spiel.</description>

      <title>A History of the Puffy Toilet Seat</title>

      <description>I always considered those things the grossest of the gross. But did get me thinking about alternative &amp;ldquo;comfortable&amp;rdquo; materials. A gel toilet seat? Cushion of air? Water? Yeah, like a water bed ‚Äî but instead it&amp;rsquo;s a toilet seat.
And if you don&amp;rsquo;t already follow the bro-science blog of Dollar Shave Club, you should. Way better than The Onion these days.</description>

      <title>Do Ants Like Coffee?</title>

      <description>üêú‚ù§Ô∏è‚òïÔ∏è
Ants are my favorite insect. That they have actually been observed to plant coffee seeds, live in and among the plants they grow, and actually harvest the beans floors me with wonder for these remarkable creatures that are so different from us, yet so much resemble us in our social behaviors. This is real agriculture; and we already know they practice ranching and husbandry behaviors, with aphids for example ‚Äî &amp;ldquo;milking&amp;rdquo; them of the dew produced by their bodies.</description>
