      <description>I always considered those things the grossest of the gross. But did get me thinking about alternative &amp;ldquo;comfortable&amp;rdquo; materials. A gel toilet seat? Cushion of air? Water? Yeah, like a water bed ‚Äî but instead it&amp;rsquo;s a toilet seat.
And if you don&amp;rsquo;t already follow the bro-science blog of Dollar Shave Club, you should. Way better than The Onion these days.</description>

Ants are my favorite insect. That they have actually been observed to plant coffee seeds, live in and among the plants they grow, and actually harvest the beans floors me with wonder for these remarkable creatures that are so different from us, yet so much resemble us in our social behaviors. This is real agriculture; and we already know they practice ranching and husbandry behaviors, with aphids for example ‚Äî &amp;ldquo;milking&amp;rdquo; them of the dew produced by their bodies.</description>
