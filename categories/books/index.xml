      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One night each week he was allowed to leave his father, his mother, and his younger brother Tom asleep in their small house next door and run here, up the dark spiral stairs to his grandparents&amp;rsquo; cupola, and in this sorcerer&amp;rsquo;s tower sleep with thunders and visions, to wake befor the crystal jingle of milk bottles and perform his ritual magic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

The wine metaphor which appears again and again in these pages is wonderfully apt. I was gathering images all of my life, storing them away, and forgetting them. Somehow I had to send myself back, with words as catalysts to open the memories out and see what they had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ray Bradbury, Just This Side of Byzantium ‚Äî An Introduction, Dandelion Wine&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summer doesn&amp;rsquo;t officially arrive for a while, but after an hour out in the Texas sun on my quarantine walk, you can start to feel the sweat pooling around your neck and dripping down your scalp. I saw somebody on Twitter recommending this as a good time to start reading (or re-reading) Ray Bradbury&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Dandelion Wine.&lt;/em&gt; Why not?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The following story is told in Sam Weller&amp;rsquo;s biography of Ray Bradbury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The soul has to make a choice, and the outcome will either break it into pieces or enable it to sail to its destination in God. And the choice comes down to this: Will the soul accept or reject suffering? Will it make this suffering its own, or struggle against it, seeing it as something alien to itself?&#xA;&amp;hellip;If he chooses to accept his suffering, he must embrace it with the wholeness of his life; he must discover and accept the proper relation to his suffering.</description>

      <description>The Death of Ivan Ilyich, Leo Tolstoy. Chapter XII From that moment the screaming began that continued for three days, and was so terrible that one could not hear it through two closed doors without horror. At the moment he answered his wife he realized that he was lost, that there was no return, that the end had come, the very end, and his doubts were still unsolved and remained doubts.</description>

No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal ‚Äî the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
