<p>My love, she weeps at many things,<br>
I would not for the world stop up her tears;<br>
She came in many years of drought<br>
And taught me just how right was private rain<br>
To touch the dust with smallest storm <br>
With emerald droppings from her eyes.<br></p>
<p>My loved one weeps at many things,<br>
Small rings and charms, the soft alarms of birds,<br>
Or sudden summer squall. Large thing or small:<br>
The way the cat puts up his bones in fur,<br>
Teakettle purrs and murmurs:<br>
Slumber. Sleep. October. Autumn. Fall.<br>
Sometimes I say a thing and do not know I say a Joy<br>
Then hear a sound and turn and there she goes full-weep.<br>
Pours forth the diamonds, lets out a cry<br>
As from a thousand hours of happy nightmare/sleep.<br></p>
<p>In all the splendid time ahead, those years<br>
With yet their secret joys unsaid,<br>
Let no one stay her tears.<br>
Praise God for them and her, praise God for eyes<br>
That smallness see, and grow it to a size,<br>
That see in me a fellow weeper found<br>
And celebrate by laying dust<br>
On our small ceremonial trysting ground.<br>
Then am I rich?<br>
Look here… I wear with grace<br>
The gifts of rain and light and love and time<br>
She&rsquo;s made and winked and left<br>
To brighten my soul&rsquo;s face.<br></p>

    <h1 id="the-death-of-ivan-ilyich-leo-tolstoy-chapter-xii">The Death of Ivan Ilyich, Leo Tolstoy. Chapter XII</h1>
<p>From that moment the screaming began that continued for three days, and was so terrible that one could not hear it through two closed doors without horror. At the moment he answered his wife he realized that he was lost, that there was no return, that the end had come, the very end, and his doubts were still unsolved and remained doubts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&rdquo; he cried in various intonations. He had begun by screaming &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and continued screaming on the letter &ldquo;O&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For three whole days, during which time did not exist for him, he struggled in that black sack into which he was being thrust by an invisible, resistless force. He struggled as a man condemned to death struggles in the hands of the executioner, knowing that he cannot save himself. And every moment he felt that despite all his efforts he was drawing nearer and nearer to what terrified him. He felt that his agony was due to his being thrust into that black hole and still more to his not being able to get right into it. He was hindered from getting into it by his conviction that his life had been a good one. That very justification of his life held him fast and prevented his moving forward, and it caused him most torment of all.</p>
<p>Suddenly some force struck him in the chest and side, making it still harder to breathe, and he fell through the hole and there at the bottom was a light. What had happened to him was like the sensation one sometimes experiences in a railway carriage when one thinks one is going backwards while one is really going forwards and suddenly becomes aware of the real direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was not the right thing,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s no matter. It can be done. But what is the right thing? he asked himself, and suddenly grew quiet.</p>
<p>This occurred at the end of the third day, two hours before his death. Just then his schoolboy son had crept softly in and gone up to the bedside. The dying man was still screaming desperately and waving his arms. His hand fell on the boy&rsquo;s head, and the boy caught it, pressed it to his lips, and began to cry.</p>
<p>At that very moment Ivan Ilych fell through and caught sight of the light, and it was revealed to him that though his life had not been what it should have been, this could still be rectified. He asked himself, &ldquo;What is the right thing?&rdquo; and grew still, listening. Then he felt that someone was kissing his hand. He opened his eyes, looked at his son, and felt sorry for him. His wife came up to him and he glanced at her. She was gazing at him open-mouthed, with undried tears on her nose and cheek and a despairing look on her face. He felt sorry for her too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am making them wretched,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;They are sorry, but it will be better for them when I die.&rdquo; He wished to say this but had not the strength to utter it. &ldquo;Besides, why speak? I must act,&rdquo; he thought. with a look at his wife he indicated his son and said: &ldquo;Take him away&hellip;sorry for him&hellip;sorry for you too&hellip;.&rdquo; He tried to add, &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; but said &ldquo;Forego&rdquo; and waved his hand, knowing that He whose understanding mattered would understand.</p>
<p>And suddenly it grew clear to him that what had been oppressing him and would not leave him was all dropping away at once from two sides, from ten sides, and from all sides. He was sorry for them, he must act so as not to hurt them: release them and free himself from these sufferings. &ldquo;How good and how simple!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;And the pain?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;What has become of it? Where are you, pain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his attention to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here it is. Well, what of it? Let the pain be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And death&hellip;where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sought his former accustomed fear of death and did not find it. &ldquo;Where is it? What death?&rdquo; There was no fear because there was no death.</p>
<p>In place of death there was light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo; he suddenly exclaimed aloud. &ldquo;What joy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To him all this happened in a single instant, and the meaning of that instant did not change. For those present his agony continued for another two hours. Something rattled in his throat, his emaciated body twitched, then the gasping and rattle became less and less frequent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo; said someone near him. He heard these words and repeated them in his soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death is finished,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;It is no more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew in a breath, stopped in the midst of a sigh, stretched out, and died.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &lsquo;Red Death&rsquo; had long devastated the country. No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal — the redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution.</p>
