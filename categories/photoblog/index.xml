      <description>A traditional Irish dinner. Corned beef and cabbage and Saldo. (Well maybe not that last bit&amp;hellip;)&#xA;Yes, it‚Äôs a cheat during Great Lent. But it‚Äôs also a long established family tradition. And St. Patrick is a special patron of ours.&#xA;For dessert, s‚Äômores over the stove, as we missed our chance for brownies today, and I neglected to hoard ice cream during the quarantine. No matter, they were delicious.&#xA;Happy St.</description>
