      <description>This year was different.
News of the virus in China had already begun to circulate late last year. The videos and stories coming out of Wuhan were quite terrifying. People being welded into their apartments to prevent them from leaving. Bodies being secretly cremated en masse by the authorities. Sick people being burned alive. You have to wonder now if any of that had any basis in reality. I have come to distrust the news, both mainstream and alternative.</description>

      <description>A traditional Irish dinner. Corned beef and cabbage and Saldo. (Well maybe not that last bit&amp;hellip;)
Yes, it’s a cheat during Great Lent. But it’s also a long established family tradition. And St. Patrick is a special patron of ours.
For dessert, s’mores over the stove, as we missed our chance for brownies today, and I neglected to hoard ice cream during the quarantine. No matter, they were delicious.
Happy St.</description>

      <description>You have unlocked bonus content!
Welcome to this retroactively inserted yearly retrospective. The date I am writing this is actually December 30, 2020. If you&amp;rsquo;ve found this page, that means you&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon some content that, while genuinely old, was not originally posted on this date. Greetings from the future! Or something. I suppose I could make some joke right now warning you to &amp;ldquo;turn back&amp;rdquo; from the dread year 2020, but that whole bit seems tired and depressing.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48578600051_4fc9c2cd49_b.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time does take its toll on the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you see when you look into a funhouse mirror? Another &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; staring out at you beneath the surface of the glass? &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; you are really just one of a whole army of such &amp;ldquo;you&amp;quot;s, none knowing for sure what side of the glass he falls on. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; you are now is just another picture frozen in time; something separate and distinct from all your past and future selves. Always dying, always being born; every thought and action carving its mark forever into the lines of your face and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine an app on your phone that would let you peer into that funhouse — would let you see those possibilities, those infinite &amp;ldquo;you&amp;quot;s that could have been. That &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, particularly those possibilities that involve you growing a beard, dying your hair, looking like a douchebag, or getting really old.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Crow at the Grand Canyon</title>

      <description>Who&amp;rsquo;s ready for fall?
You can count me in, though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure &amp;ldquo;ready&amp;rdquo; is the best word for it. Summer seemed to pass by so fast this year. Barely had time to really enjoy it, it seems, before it&amp;rsquo;s practically gone. They say this happens as you get older, but I suspect in my case it has more to do with a dearth of time spent outside this year, soaking up sun and heat.</description>
