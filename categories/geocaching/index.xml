      <title>Super Mega Fun Pack</title>

      <description>The Super Mega Fun Pack geocache (GC5Z4X7) is a thinly-veiled tribute to Matt of dinosaurdracula.com and the amazing box of goodies that he puts together every month for his hordes of devoted fans. It&amp;rsquo;s only &amp;ldquo;veiled&amp;rdquo; at all because of the (understandable) policy of geocaching.com not to list any cache with references to commercial products. After going back and forth with them a bit about this, I relented and removed any overt references to Matt or his website, including changing the name of the cache from the original &amp;ldquo;The Dino Drac Fun Pack Geocache&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Super Mega Fun Pack&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>TheVCubeSolver and I hit the road on a pretty March morning to do some maintenance on a couple of our geocaches. The log for RtW #3 had filled up and Augie&amp;rsquo;s beaver cache had recently been reported missing. A little town, a little country. More geocaching goodness for you.</description>

      <description>Come along with the kids and I on our first night caching adventure. For the uninitiated among you, night caching is simply geocaching at night. Generally night caches are made so that you can&amp;rsquo;t find them during the daytime, by making use of trails of reflective tacks or tape or other forms of guidance visible only at night.</description>
