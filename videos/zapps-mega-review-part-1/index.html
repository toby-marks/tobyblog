        <p>I got to know Brian in 2013 after becoming a fan of his blog, reviewtheworld.com. Toward the end of that year I sent him the first of what I would come to call &ldquo;care packs&rdquo; for the show — just donated items for potential review on the site. That particular pack was a huge sampler of Zapps potato chips, a Louisiana snack of which I am quite fond. It took about six months for him to feature the first video. He was running the show twice a month back in those days, and I recall he had his schedule planned out months in advance. He was quite organized that way. That impressed me about him — the professionalism he showed toward the blog.</p>
<p>I thought he and the boys did a quite a nice job on this three-part review, setting a strong pace for 2014.</p>
