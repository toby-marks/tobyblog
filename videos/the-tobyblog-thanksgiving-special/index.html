        <p>After taking some time off to contemplate the overwhelming success of my Burger King poop tweet*, we now return to our regularly scheduled programming.</p>

<p>In truth October is always a busy month for us and I don&rsquo;t have much spare time for blogging. This past Halloween was without a doubt the best yet, but I&rsquo;ll save that retrospective for another day. For today we find ourselves at the end of November, as grand a month as any. November is when fall really kicks in North Texas, and although it wasn&rsquo;t much compared to the gorgeous fall of 2013, we still managed to get some decent color in a few spots. November to me means the start of prime geocaching season, the arrival of a certain coffee chain&rsquo;s special Thanksgiving blend, (something I genuinely anticipate all year), and most of all our sumptuous Thanksgiving feast, lovingly prepared by my very talented wife. Thanksgiving is a fine holiday, too often neglected these days.</p>

<p>It is a real American holiday, in the truest and best sense.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t intended at the start of my little vacation to do a Thanksgiving special. That was TheVCubeSolver&rsquo;s idea. But I thought it was a good one. And next year we may do a Christmas Special — who knows? I hope you like it. It&rsquo;s got some outdoors, some indoors, some geocaching, some product reviews, and a very special guest cooking segment by my brother Randy as he cooks up a mess of deer balls.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>And Happy Thanksgiving!</p>
